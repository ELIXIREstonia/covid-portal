toc: false

The form below can be used to add a new biobank to the Swedish COVID-19 Biobank Registry which is part of the Swedish national COVID-19 data portal. All information provided in the form below will be displayed on the page of the biobank in the registry. Please fill in as many fields as possible so that the researchers have a good idea about what they can expect from the biobank.

Note that we distinguish between *biobanks* and *collections within biobanks*. Even if a biobank has a single collection, you should fill out both the form for adding a new biobank and the form for adding a new collection. If you would like to add a collection to a biobank that has already been registered, please fill out [the form for submitting a collection instead](/biobanks/add_collection/).
