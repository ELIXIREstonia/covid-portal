In Spring 2020, researchers at [SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se/) and KTH Royal Institute of Technology have developed a serological test that can detect antibodies against COVID-19. This high-throughput serology test was developed in collaboration with Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital and the Public Health Agency of Sweden, which have been engaged in evaluating and validating the test. The test [displayed accurate results](https://www.scilifelab.se/covid-19/kaw-program/serology/) and is considered highly reliable. Subsequently, the SciLifeLabâ€™s [Autoimmunity Profiling facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/autoimmunity-profiling/) has carried out up to 8000 of such tests per week.

The development of the test has been coordinated by Peter Nilsson (SciLifeLab/KTH), Sophia Hober (KTH). The project is funded by KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Region Stockholm, Atlas Copco, Family Christian and Jennifer Dahlberg, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Erling-Persson Family Foundation.
