During early phases of the Covid-19 pandemic, three [KTH](https://www.kth.se) research groups and the [Autoimmunity profiling facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/autoimmunity-profiling/) at [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se) set out to [develop a serological assay](https://www.scilifelab.se/covid-19/kaw-program/serology/) for large scale testing of plasma and serum samples for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The work was initiated and coordinated by the three KTH professors Peter Nilsson, Sophia Hober and My Hedhammar.

The development of the assay has been funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, Erling-Persson Family Foundation, KTH, SciLifeLab, Region Stockholm, Atlas Copco, Family Christian and Jennifer Dahlberg.

By comparing and combining large number of variants of SARS-CoV-2 proteins as antigens, a highly sensitive and specific multiplex bead-based assay was established and applied in high throughput with up to 8000 samples analysed per week. The vast majority of samples analysed so far have been collected from health care personnel and within population based studies as well as from personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and also within a long range of research collaborations. Sample providers and research collaborators include [Danderyd University Hospital](https://www.scilifelab.se/news/four-out-of-five-still-have-antibodies-against-sars-cov-2), Karolinska University Hospital, Uppsala University Hospital, Skåne University Hospital, Örebro University Hospital, Sophiahemmet Hospital, Public Health Agency of Sweden, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, AstraZeneca, Cytiva, Karolinska Institutet, KTH, Uppsala University and Lund University.

The SciLifeLab facility has now changed its name to [Autoimmunity and Serology Profiling facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/autoimmunity-profiling/).
