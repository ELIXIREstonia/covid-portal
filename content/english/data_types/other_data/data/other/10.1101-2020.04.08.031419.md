         "abstract":"Transcriptome analysis has mainly relied on analyzing RNA sequencing data from whole cells, overlooking the impact of subcellular RNA localization and its influence on our understanding of gene function, and interpretation of gene expression signatures in cells. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes in human fetal and adult brain samples. We show significant differences in RNA expression for protein-coding and lncRNA genes between cytosol and nucleus. Transcripts displaying differential subcellular localization belong to particular functional categories and display tissue-specific localization patterns. We also show that transcripts encoding the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are significantly enriched in the cytosol compared to the rest of protein-coding genes. Further investigation of the use of the cytosolic or the nuclear transcriptome for differential gene expression analysis indicates important differences in results depending on the cellular compartment. These differences were manifested at the level of transcript types and the number of differentially expressed genes. Our data provide a resource of RNA subcellular localization in the human brain and highlight differences in using the cytosolic or the nuclear transcriptomes for differential expression analysis.",
