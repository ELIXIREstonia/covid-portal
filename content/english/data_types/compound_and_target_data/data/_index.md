## Published Data

#### General useful data sources

* Small molecule related data can be found in ChEMBL ([https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)). ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.

#### Data available on the European COVID-19 Data Portal

* [COVID-19 pathways, interactions, complexes, targets and compounds](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/biochemistry?db=biochemistry)
