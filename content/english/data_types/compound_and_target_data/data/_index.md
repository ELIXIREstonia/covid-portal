## Published Data

On our portal, “Biochemistry” has a broad meaning, including cell- and plasma profiling with, for example, biomarker concentrations in plasma.

#### General useful data sources

* Small molecule related data can be found in [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.

#### Data available on the European COVID-19 Data Portal

* [COVID-19 pathways, interactions, complexes, targets and compounds](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/biochemistry?db=biochemistry)
