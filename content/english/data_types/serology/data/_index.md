##  Estonian serology data
Several serology surveys have been or are being carried out in Estonia.

Case study, [KORO-SERO-EST-1](https://www.ctm.ee/en/covid-19/koroonaviirus-sars-cov-2-antikehade-serolevimusuuring-eestis-kahe-piirkonna-testuuring/), where, on the basis of a random selection by the Estonian Health Insurance Fund, 1,080 persons from the Järveotsa family medicine center and 1,080 persons from the Kuressaare family medicine center were invited to the study. The study included people from all age groups, from newborns to 100 years of age, on a random basis. 120 people in each 10-year-old age group were invited to participate, with the exception of those aged 80-100, for whom a total of 120 people are invited to participate in the study. 

[KORO-SERO-EST-1 follow-up survey](https://www.ctm.ee/en/covid-19/korosero-est-1-jareluuring/), where persons initially taking part of the KoroSero-EST-1 study from the Kuressaare and Järveotsa Family Medicine Centers. The study identified 73 seropositive subjects and age- and gender-matched seronegative controls (n = 146). Subjects were invited to the study by their own GP staff.

Case study, [KORO-SERO-EST-2](https://www.ctm.ee/en/covid-19/ule-eestiline-sars-cov-2-antikehade-serolevimusuuring-korosero-est-2/), where the study includes blood sera from patients in all county GP centers until the sample size calculated for that county is completed. In the course of the study, it was planned to analyze 3400 blood sera - 200 blood sera from each Estonian county, except Saare county (it is planned to analyze 600 blood sera).

Case study, [KORO-SERO-EST-3](https://www.ctm.ee/en/covid-19/ule-eestiline-sars-cov-2-antikehade-serolevimusuuring-1-aasta-pandeemia-algusest-eestis-korosero-est-3/), is a nationwide seroprevalence study performed using pseudonymed blood sera sent to SYNLAB laboratories. Only the age, sex, date of blood collection and family medicine center from which the serum was sent to the SYNLAB laboratory will be provided to researchers at the University of Tartu. Blood sera are tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the SYNLAB Laboratory. The study covers a total of about 2,600 blood sera from all Estonian counties and all age groups (people aged 0-100).

[National Prevalence Study](https://www.ut.ee/et/teadus/koroonaviiruse-levimuse-uuring-covid-19-active-seire), where researchers from the University of Tartu find out the actual spread of coronavirus and the course of the epidemic with a cross-sectional survey In Estonia. On the basis of a random sample, people from all over Estonia are interviewed and tested in order to provide the country with evidence-based data to decide on measures to curb the spread of the virus. The survey is funded by the Government of the Republic of Estonia. The National Prevalence Study's first wave started on April 23, 2020. The duration of each survey wave is one week. Since wave 14 of the surveillance study, levels of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies have been determined in participants' blood samples.

## Open data
