title: Environmental virus profiling data
---

This section of the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal is focused on environmental data on SARS-CoV-2. We present wastewater epidemiology data from four Swedish cities - Uppsala, Stockholm, Umeå, and Örebro, with a total population of 1.5 million people. Wastewater surveilance could prove an effective system for monitoring COVID-19 prevalence and an early warning system for predicting upcoming outbreaks. Other environmental data will be added in the future.
