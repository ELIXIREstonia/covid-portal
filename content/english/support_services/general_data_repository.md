## General data repositories

Most science data types can be published as raw data or as processed data in data repositories, such as [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk), as described below in the [data types chapter](https://covid19dataportal.ee/ee/data_types/). If a professional repository/archive is not appropriate, we recommend using a general purpose repository such as [Figshare](https://figshare.com) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org). This includes documents, presentations, drawings, minutes or other information that you want to disclose at each stage of the research. The publication of data on these platforms is permanent and provides a pseudo-identifier (DOI).

If you have databases related to COVID-19 research that are best suited for this type of repository or need to upload data, please contact [ELIXIR Estonia] (https://elixir.ut.ee/) (elixir@ut.ee).
