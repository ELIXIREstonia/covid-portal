The Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal invites researchers and public to take part in the **COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition** with small-scale projects. The purpose of the competition is to reuse data or code in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics. Three winning projects will be awarded support in the best possible way from the SciLifeLab Data Centre. This support will be tailored to your projects needs and can consists of free hosting (for example as a shiny app or as a website) for one year, free storage for one year, a feature on the COVID-19 Data portal (for example as a data highlight or as a page with visualizations) and visibility through press and social media of SciLifeLab and SciLifeLab Data Centre.

We welcome projects that consist of re-analysis of publicly published data using a method different from the original analysis method or asking a question different from the original research question for which the data was collected; projects consisting of reusing publicly shared analysis code on a new set of data; individual visualisations or dashboards presenting publicly shared data in a novel way. The emphasis of the projects submitted to the competition should be to maximize the utility of the already collected data or already written code.

There are two conditions which projects need to meet in order to be eligible for competing in the COVID-19 Data and Code Reuse Competition. The first condition is that you reuse data or code that is publicly available, with a DOI or on a public repository. We encourage you to search for data or code in the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal, the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org), or any other [national COVID-19 Data Portals](https://covid19dataportal.se/partners/). Participants are welcome to use data and code shared by other researchers, as well as their own data and code which has previously been made available through these portals. The second condition is that the projects should be submitted as items to the SciLifeLab Data Repository and tagged with the keyword “COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition”.

## Who can submit an entry?
- The competition is **open to everyone**; both from academia (students, PhD students, postdocs, researchers, etc.) and the wider community.
- Competition entries can be submitted either by **individuals or in a group**. Collaborative projects are welcome.

## How does the competition work?
- Participants are welcome to enter small-scale research projects that contribute to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic or to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 into the competition. This can include for example reprocessing of existing data, visualisations, new web services, reproducing existing studies etc. Projects containing both positive, as well as negative results may be entered.
- Each competition entry has too reuse either data or code that is publicly available with a DOI or on a public repository. If the data or code has a license be sure to adhere to the license agreement.
- Participants are welcome to reuse their own data or their own code, previously published, for new projects.
- Participants retain all rights to their project and are welcome to use the project outcome as part of any further work they wish to conduct or any publications and such.
- Submit an entry to SciLifeLab Data Repository (hosted by FigShare) of your project outcome (e.g. poster, presentation, dashboard, or a link). Once submitted, your entry will be findable, citable, and receive a unique DOI.
- All data, code and other materials used in the competition entries should be made publicly available as part of the SciLifeLab Data Repository item.

## How to submit an entry
- Submit the resulting project as an entry to the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://scilifelab.figshare.com) . You can log in with your Swedish University ID or if you are not affiliated with a Swedish university get in touch with the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal team at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) to obtain an account.
- Follow the SciLifeLab Data Repository [submission guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/) to add your entry.
- Add the keyword “COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition” in the metadata form field called “Keywords” of your entry on the SciLifeLab Data Repository .
- Add a link to the reused data or code in the metadata form field called “Description” of your entry on the SciLifeLab Data Repository and clearly state that this is the data or code reused in your project.
- Submissions to SciLifeLab Data Repository will go through standard review process. In general the review process takes about one week. Your submission must be approved and published by the deadline.
- Contributions will be accepted between the 15th of May until the 15th of September.

## Evaluation criteria
- The submitted projects will be evaluated on the following criteria:
  - demonstrated value of data or code reuse in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics
  - clear scientific documentation and communication of the results
  - fulfillment of entry criteria
- The winning entries will be selected by a jury lead by the COVID-19 Data Portal team members.
