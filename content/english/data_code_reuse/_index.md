The [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/) invites researchers and general public to take part in the **COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition** with small-scale projects that make use of publicly shared data or code to contribute to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics.

Three winning projects will be awarded support from the [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://scilifelab.se/data) to promote the project and/or to enable follow-up work. The exact type of support provided will be tailored to the needs of each project and can consist of, for example, free hosting for one year, free storage for one year, a feature on the COVID-19 Data portal (for example, as a data highlight or as a page with visualizations), and visibility through press and social media of SciLifeLab and SciLifeLab Data Centre.

We welcome projects that consist of re-analysis of publicly published data using a method different from the original analysis method or asking a question different from the original research question; projects consisting of reusing publicly shared analysis code on a new set of data; individual visualisations or dashboards presenting publicly shared data in a novel way; web-services devoted to data and analyses. The emphasis of the projects submitted to the competition should be to maximize the utility of the already collected data or already written code.

#### Who can submit an entry?

- The competition is **open to everyone**; both from academia (students, PhD candidates, postdocs, researchers, etc.) and the wider community.
- Competition entries can be submitted either by **individuals or groups**. Collaborative projects are welcome.

#### How does the competition work?

- Participants are welcome to enter small-scale research projects that contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic or the fight against future pandemics into the competition. The submitted projects should have a clear goal and outcome. Participants are welcome to spend as much or as little time on their competition entry as they wish.
- Each competition entry has too reuse either data or code that was previously made publicly available with a DOI or in a public repository. We encourage the participants to search for data or code through the [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.se/), the [European COVID-19 Data Portal](https://covid19dataportal.org), and other [national COVID-19 Data Portals](https://covid19dataportal.se/partners/). Be sure to adhere to the license conditions under which the original data or code were published.
- Participants are welcome to reuse their own data or their own code for new projects as long they have previously been made publicly available.
- Participants retain all rights to their project and are welcome to use the project outcome as part of any further work they wish to conduct or any publications and such.

#### How to submit an entry?

- To enter a project into the competition, submit your project outcome (e.g. a PDF, a poster, a presentation, a dashboard, or a link) as an entry to the [SciLifeLab Data Repository](https://scilifelab.figshare.com/). You can log in with your Swedish university user ID or if you are not affiliated with a Swedish university get in touch with the Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal team at [datacentre@scilifelab.se](mailto:datacentre@scilifelab.se) to obtain an account.
- Any newly generated data, code and other materials should be made publicly available as part of the SciLifeLab Data Repository item.
- Follow the SciLifeLab Data Repository [submission guidelines](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/repository/submission/) to add your entry.
- Add information about, along with a link to, the source of the original data or code used in the project to the field called "Description" of your entry.
- Add the keyword “COVID-19 Data & Code Reuse Competition” in the field called “Keywords” of your entry.
- Competition entries will go through standard review process of the SciLifeLab Data Repository. Please note that the review process takes about one week. Your submission must be approved and published by the deadline.
- Competition entries will be accepted between the 15th of May and the 15th of September 2021.

#### Evaluation criteria

- The submitted projects will be evaluated on the following criteria:
    - fulfillment of entry criteria;
    - demonstrated value of data or code reuse in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics;
    - clear scientific documentation and communication of the results.
- The winning entries will be selected by a jury led by the [COVID-19 Data Portal team members](/about/).
