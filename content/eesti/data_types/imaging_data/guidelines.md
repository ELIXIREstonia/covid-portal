## Guidelines for COVID-19 data
Make your COVID-19 research data useful and accessible for the rest of the research community by publishing in a public repository together with descriptive metadata.

[NBIS](http://www.nbis.se/) can support you with Data Management Planning early on in the projects to make data sharing more efficient, both through [personal consultations](https://nbis.se/support/supportform/index.php?form=consultation) and by providing a [customised tool](https://dsw.scilifelab.se/) to create Data Management Plans. We can also assist you in identifying relevant repositories and common international standards for describing and publishing your data, as well as guide you through the submission process.

### Repositories
Depending on the type of image data you have, different public repositories are available, please see the table at [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/).

### Metadata
Metadata provides 'data about data' , and may include information on the methodology used to collect the data, analytical and procedural information, definitions of variables, units of measurement, any assumptions made, the format and file type of the data and software used to collect and/or process the data. Researchers are strongly encouraged to use community metadata standards where these are in place.

<!--- Suggestions of specifik metadata standards --->

It is highly recommended to, already from the beginning of the project, structure e.g. sample metadata in a way that enables sequence data submission  without having to reformat the metadata.
