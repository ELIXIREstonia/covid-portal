Facilities which offer data generation services for imaging:

* [ALM](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/alm/) Advanced Light Microscopy facility give support with advanced fluorescence microscopy for nanoscale biological visualization using SIM, STED, STORM/PALM superresolution imaging. The facility also support single molecule spectroscopy measurement and analysis with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), as well as combined with superresolution dynamical studies (STED-FCS). Moreover, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy support allow users to image live and/or optically cleared larger samples. Submit your application at the NMI (National Microscopy Infrastructure) [project portal](https://nmi.scilifelab.se/).

* [Cryo-EM](https://cryoem.scilifelab.se/) offers access to state-of-the-art equipment and expertise in single particle cryo-EM and cryo-tomography (cryo-ET).

* [Cell Profiling](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/cell-profiling/) facility supports full service for immunofluorescence projects at moderate to high-throughput level and highly multiplex imaging (>30 protein markers) in fresh frozen (FF) and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections with spatial information at single cell level. It has a unique postion to investigate subcellular spatial proteomics for human and rodent biology by taking advantages of the resource of more than 25,000 antibodies and a panel of >20 different human cell lines from the [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/). In 2018 the facility entered an Early Access program for the [CODEX platform](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/cell-profiling/codex) to run highly multiplex imaging, as one of ten labs world wide.

Facilities which offer data analysis services for imaging:

* [BioImage Informatics Facility](https://www.scilifelab.se/facilities/bioimage-informatics/) provides support and education in image analysis in order to help users get started with their own analysis.
