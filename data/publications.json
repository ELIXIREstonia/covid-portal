Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Iraqi government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities and limiting population's mobility. In this study, concentrations of four criteria pollutants, NO 2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 before the lockdown from January 16 to February 29, 2020, and during four periods of partial and total lockdown from March 1 to July 24, 2020, in Baghdad were analysed. Overall, 6, 8 and 15% decreases in NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations, respectively in Baghdad during the 1st partial and total lockdown from March 1 to April 21, compared to the period before the lockdown. While, there were 13% increase in O3 for same period. During the 2nd partial lockdown from June 14 to July 24, NO2 and PM2.5 decreases 20 and 2.5%, respectively. While, there were 525 and 56% increase in O3 and PM10, respectively for same period. The air quality index (AQI) improved by 13% in Baghdad during the 1st partial lockdown from March 1 to April 21, compared to its pre-lockdown. The results of NO2 tropospheric column extracted from the Sentinel-5P satellite shown the NO2 emissions reduced up to 35 to 40% across Iraq, due to lockdown measures, between January and July, 2020, especially across the major cities such as Baghdad, Basra and Erbil.

Rural areas of developing countries pose particular difficulties for developing and implementing effective responses owing to underdeveloped health infrastructure, uneven state capacity for infection control, and endemic poverty. This paper makes the case for the critical role of local governance in coordinating pandemic response by examining how state authorities are attempting to bridge the gap between the need for rapid, vigorous response to the pandemic and local realities in three Indian states - Rajasthan, Odisha, and Kerala. Through a combination of interviews with mid and low-level bureaucrats and a review of policy documents, we show how the urgency of COVID-19 response has galvanized new kinds of cross-sectoral and multi-scalar interaction between administrative units involved in coordinating responses, as local governments have assumed central responsibility in the implementation of disease control and social security mechanisms. Evidence from Kerala in particular suggests that the state's long term investment in democratic local government and arrangements for incorporating women within grassroots state functions (through its Kudumbashree program) has built a high degree of public trust and cooperation with state actors, while local authorities embrace an ethic of care in the implementation of state responses. These observations, from the early months of the pandemic in South Asia, can serve as a foundation for future studies of how existing institutional arrangements and their histories pattern the long-term success of disease control and livelihood support as the pandemic proceeds. Governance, we argue, will be as important to understanding the trajectory of COVID-19 impacts and recovery as biology, demography, and economy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105234", "pmid": "33106724", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0305-750X(20)30361-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7578699"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:47:52.870Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T11:47:52.885Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "53ae2386675c4a4ba33a03cf8ce33fb7", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/53ae2386675c4a4ba33a03cf8ce33fb7.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/53ae2386675c4a4ba33a03cf8ce33fb7"}}, "title": "The ABCs of Covid-19 prevention in Malawi: Authority, benefits, and costs of compliance.", "authors": [{"family": "Kao", "given": "Kristen", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lust", "given": "Ellen", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Dulani", "given": "Boniface", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Ferree", "given": "Karen E", "initials": "KE"}, {"family": "Harris", "given": "Adam S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Metheney", "given": "Erica", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2021-01-00", "journal": {"title": "World Dev", "issn": "0305-750X", "volume": "137", "issue": null, "pages": "105167", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "A wide array of authorities-from religious leaders to government ministers-call upon citizens to take preventative measures against Covid-19. Which authorities can most effectively gain public compliance, and which measures will the public take up? Moreover, do people comply with authorities out of respect for their legitimacy, due to their expertise, or for fear of sanctioning? Answers to these questions are important for development practitioners, who need to understand how different partnerships might affect health behavior, and for scholars interested in understanding authority, legitimacy, and compliance. We explore these questions using a conjoint experiment embedded in a telephone survey of 641 Malawians. Individuals in our sample are more likely to say that they will comply with precautionary measures when the costs are low and expected benefits are high. Respondents view both traditional authorities and hospital heads as legitimately issuing directives and having the ability to monitor and sanction non-compliance, but appear to comply more with hospital heads and to do so out of respect for their expertise. These results emphasize how who issues directives affects whether individuals comply and provides insights as to why they do so. The findings also reflect individuals' cost-benefit calculations when considering precautionary measures, highlighting the importance of steps that can reduce costs (e.g., food security or income measures) or accurately reflect risks (e.g., information signaling the prevalence of Covid-19).

Complete blood count (CBC), however, has not been available at the POC in a simple-to-use device until recently. The HemoScreen, which was recently cleared by the FDA for POC use, is a miniature, easy-to-use instrument that uses disposable cartridges and may fill this gap.\n\nThe HemoScreen's analysis method, in contrast to standard laboratory analyzers, is based on machine vision (image-based analysis) and artificial intelligence (AI). We discuss the different methods currently used and compare their results to the vision-based one. The HemoScreen is found to correlate well to laser and impedance-based methods while emphasis is given to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and platelets (PLT) that demonstrate better correlation when the vision-based method is compared to itself due to the essential differences between the underlying technologies.\n\nThe HemoScreen analyzer demonstrates lab equivalent performance, tested at different clinical settings and sample characteristics, and might outperform standard techniques in the presence of certain interferences.

The strength of PHEIC declarations is the ability to rapidly mobilize international coordination, streamline funding and accelerate the advancement of the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics under emergency use authorization.

Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps in knowledge and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that took place in April 2020, which targeted people residing in Jordan, aged 18 and above. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, males, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety levels. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0243264", "pmid": "33270783", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "PONE-D-20-21682"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-06T07:09:15.849Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.152Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d10da61364bd4d2ba71ac7c1e0001a18", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d10da61364bd4d2ba71ac7c1e0001a18.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d10da61364bd4d2ba71ac7c1e0001a18"}}, "title": "Correction to: Clinical features, ventilatory management, and outcome of ARDS caused by COVID-19 are similar to other causes of ARDS.", "authors": [{"family": "Ferrando", "given": "Carlos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Suarez-Sipmann", "given": "Fernando", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mellado-Artigas", "given": "Ricard", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "given": "Mar\u00eda", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gea", "given": "Alfredo", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Arruti", "given": "Egoitz", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Aldecoa", "given": "C\u00e9sar", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Mart\u00ednez-Pall\u00ed", "given": "Graciela", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez", "given": "Miguel A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Slutsky", "given": "Arthur S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Villar", "given": "Jes\u00fas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "COVID-19 Spanish ICU Network", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "published erratum", "published": "2020-12-02", "journal": {"title": "Intensive Care Med", "issn": "1432-1238", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0342-4642"}, "abstract": "The original version of this article unfortunately contained mistakes in Figures 1 and 3.", "doi": "10.1007/s00134-020-06251-8", "pmid": "33263817", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00134-020-06251-8"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:15:09.651Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:45:39.142Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "68f8998fb8eb43d1b66b8b9accbeedbb", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/68f8998fb8eb43d1b66b8b9accbeedbb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/68f8998fb8eb43d1b66b8b9accbeedbb"}}, "title": "Dietary supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic: insights from 1.4M users of the COVID Symptom Study app -

This structural snapshot describes the structural bases underlying the pandemic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 and explains its fast motion over respiratory epithelia that allow its rapid cellular entry. Based on notable viral spike (S) protein features, we propose that the flat sialic acid-binding domain at the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit leads to more effective first contact and interaction with the sialic acid layer over the epithelium and this, in turn, allows faster viral \"surfing\" of the epithelium and receptor scanning by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) protein on the epithelial surface is the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and protein-protein interaction assays demonstrate high-affinity binding of the S protein to ACE-2. To date, no high-frequency mutations were detected at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the S1 subunit in the S protein, where the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located. Tight binding to ACE-2 by a conserved viral RBD suggests the ACE2-RBD interaction is likely optimal. Moreover, the viral S subunit contains a cleavage site for furin and other proteases, which accelerates cell entry by SARS-CoV-2. The model proposed here describes a structural basis for the accelerated host cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 relative to other HCoVs, and also discusses emerging hypotheses that are likely to contribute to the development of antiviral strategies to combat the pandemic capacity of SARS-CoV-2.", "doi": "10.1111/febs.15651", "pmid": "33264497", "labels": {"Data type: Protein data": null, "Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:14:27.869Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:14:51.870Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "baaedfcf6bed471ba1aff4e643a673f0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/baaedfcf6bed471ba1aff4e643a673f0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/baaedfcf6bed471ba1aff4e643a673f0"}}, "title": "The association of mode of location activity and mobility with acute coronary syndrome: nationwide ecological study.", "authors": [{"family": "Mohammad", "given": "Moman A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Koul", "given": "Sasha", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gale", "given": "Chris P", "initials": "CP"}, {"family": "Alfredsson", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "James", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fr\u00f6bert", "given": "Ole", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Omerovic", "given": "Elmir", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Erlinge", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"title": "J Intern Med", "issn": "1365-2796", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We aimed to study the effect of social containment mandates on ACS presentation during COVID-19 pandemic using location activity and mobility data from mobile phone map services.\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) including all ACS presentations during the pandemic until May 07, 2020.

The viral units isolation or trapping by the adsorption on the kaolinite nanoparticles producing structural distortion of the peptide ligands could lead to the blockage of the entry on the receptor and hence a lack of viral activity would be produced.

Although primarily affecting the lungs, the SARS-CoV-2 virus also affects the cardiovascular system. In addition to cardiac effects, e.g. myocarditis, arrhythmias, and myocardial damage, the vasculature is affected in COVID-19, both directly by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and indirectly as a result of a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm. This includes the role of the vascular endothelium in the recruitment of inflammatory leucocytes where they contribute to tissue damage and cytokine release, which are key drivers of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. There is also evidence linking endothelial cells (ECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection including: (i) the expression and function of its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the vasculature; (ii) the prevalence of a Kawasaki disease-like syndrome (vasculitis) in COVID-19; and (iii) evidence of EC infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with fatal COVID-19. Here, the Working Group on Atherosclerosis and Vascular Biology together with the Council of Basic Cardiovascular Science of the European Society of Cardiology provide a Position Statement on the importance of the endothelium in the underlying pathophysiology behind the clinical presentation in COVID-19 and identify key questions for future research to address. We propose that endothelial biomarkers and tests of function (e.g. flow-mediated dilatation) should be evaluated for their usefulness in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients. A better understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial biology in both the micro- and macrovasculature is required, and endothelial function testing should be considered in the follow-up of convalescent COVID-19 patients for early detection of long-term cardiovascular complications.", "doi": "10.1093/cvr/cvaa230", "pmid": "32750108", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5880580"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7454368"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T15:56:02.856Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T15:56:02.880Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "447cc7afc9f745eba4a64bd311f4a71e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/447cc7afc9f745eba4a64bd311f4a71e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/447cc7afc9f745eba4a64bd311f4a71e"}}, "title": "Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency.", "authors": [{"family": "Delavari", "given": "Samaneh", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Abolhassani", "given": "Hassan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Abolnezhadian", "given": "Farhad", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Babaha", "given": "Fateme", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Iranparast", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ahanchian", "given": "Hamid", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Moazzen", "given": "Nasrin", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nabavi", "given": "Mohammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Arshi", "given": "Saba", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Fallahpour", "given": "Morteza", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bemanian", "given": "Mohammad Hassan", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Shokri", "given": "Sima", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Momen", "given": "Tooba", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sadeghi-Shabestari", "given": "Mahnaz", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Molatefi", "given": "Rasol", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Shirkani", "given": "Afshin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Vosughimotlagh", "given": "Ahmad", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Safarirad", "given": "Molood", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sharifzadeh", "given": "Meisam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pashangzadeh", "given": "Salar", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Salami", "given": "Fereshte", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Shirmast", "given": "Paniz", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Rezaei", "given": "Arezou", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Moeini Shad", "given": "Tannaz", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Mohraz", "given": "Minoo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rezaei", "given": "Nima", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "given": "Lennart", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Yazdani", "given": "Reza", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Aghamohamamdi", "given": "Asghar", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-12-01", "journal": {"title": "J Clin Immunol", "issn": "1573-2592", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0271-9142"}, "abstract": "Although it is estimated that COVID-19 life-threatening conditions may be diagnosed in less than 1:1000 infected individuals below the age of 50, but the real impact of this pandemic on pediatric patients with different types of primary immunodeficiency (PID) is not elucidated.

This is especially important in real-time surveillance, where the aim is to gain situational awareness, for example, if cases are currently increasing or decreasing. Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria. It is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers changes in the reporting delay distribution over time and associated with the weekday of reporting. Furthermore, we present a way to estimate the effective time-varying case reproduction number based on predictions of the nowcast. The approaches are based on previously published work, that we considerably extended and adapted to the current task of nowcasting COVID-19 cases. We provide methodological details of the developed approach, illustrate results based on data of the current pandemic, and evaluate the model based on synthetic and retrospective data on COVID-19 in Bavaria. Results of our nowcasting are reported to the Bavarian health authority and published on a webpage on a daily basis (https://corona.stat.uni-muenchen.de/). Code and synthetic data for the analysis are available from https://github.com/FelixGuenther/nc_covid19_bavaria and can be used for adaption of our approach to different data.

Adverse outcomes with COVID-19 have been linked to cytokine storm but the most effective way to address exaggerated inflammatory response is complex and unclear. The Expert Working Group on the Commission of Human Medicines in the UK and other organizations have stated that there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between ibuprofen and susceptibility to or exacerbation of COVID-19. NSAID use must also be categorized by whether the drugs are relatively low-dose over-the-counter oral products taken occasionally versus higher-dose or parenteral NSAIDs. Even if evidence emerged arguing for or against NSAIDs in this setting, it is unclear if this evidence would apply to all NSAIDs at all doses in all dosing regimens. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been proposed as an alternative to NSAIDs but there are issues with liver toxicity at high doses.

English studies that evaluated the effect of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with COVID-19 were included. Studies' quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were analyzed using the random-effects modeling stratified by exposure (ACEIs/ARBs, ACEIs, and ARBs). Heterogeneiity was assessed using I 2 statistic. Several subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the impact of potential confounders. Overall, 27 studies were eligible. The pooled analyses showed nonsignificant associations between ACEIs/ARBs and death (OR:0.97, 95%CI:0.75,1.27), ICU admission (OR:1.09;95%CI:0.65,1.81), death/ICU admission (OR:0.67; 95%CI:0.52,0.86), risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:1.01; 95%CI:0.93,1.10), severe infection (OR:0.78; 95%CI:0.53,1.15), and hospitalization (OR:1.15; 95%CI:0.81,1.65).

As input data, we used COVID-19 epidemiological information collected in fifteen European countries either in private surveys or using official statistics. Thirteen countries implemented lockdown measures, two countries (Sweden, Iceland) not. As output parameters, we studied herd immunity level and time of formation. Comparison of these parameters was used as an indicator of effectiveness / ineffectiveness of lockdown measures. In the absence of a medical vaccine, herd immunity may be regarded as a factor of population adaptation to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, the viral pathogen causing COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), and hence COVID-19 spreading stop. We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum.

The term \"precision health\" is being increasingly used to express the need for greater awareness of environmental and genomic characteristics that may lead to divergent health outcomes between different groups within a population. Enhancing awareness of diversity has parallels with calls for \"health democracy\" and greater patient-public participation within health care and medical research. Approaching health care in this way goes beyond a narrow focus on the societal determinants of health, since it requires considering health as a deliberative space, which occurs often at the banal or everyday level. As an initial empirical focus, PHED is directed toward the health needs of marginalized migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with temporary residency, often involving a legally or economically precarious situation) as vulnerable groups that are often overlooked by health care. Developing new transdisciplinary knowledge on these groups provides the potential to enhance their wellbeing and benefit the wider society through challenging the exclusions of these groups that create pockets of extreme ill-health, which, as we see with COVID-19, should be better understood as \"acts of self-harm\" for the wider negative impact on humanity.\n\nWe aim to establish and identify precision health strategies, as well as promote equal access to quality health care, drawing upon knowledge gained from studying the health care of marginalized migrants.\n\nThe project is based in Sweden at Malm\u00f6 and Lund Universities. At the outset, the network activities do not require ethical approval where they will not involve data collection, since the purpose of PHED is to strengthen international research contacts, establish new research within precision strategies, and construct educational research activities for junior colleagues within academia. However, whenever new research is funded and started, ethical approval for that specific data collection will be sought.\n\nThe PHED project has been funded from January 1, 2019. Results of the transdisciplinary collaboration will be disseminated via a series of international conferences, workshops, and web-based materials. To ensure the network project advances toward applied research, a major goal of dissemination is to produce tools for applied research, including information to enhance health accessibility for vulnerable communities, such as marginalized migrant populations in Sweden.\n\nThere is a need to identify tools to enable the prevention and treatment of a wide spectrum of health-related outcomes and their link to social as well as environmental issues. There is also a need to identify and investigate barriers to precision health based on democratic principles.\n\nDERR1-10.2196/17324.", "doi": "10.2196/17324", "pmid": "33252352", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "v9i11e17324"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:24:10.169Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:24:10.192Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9159f26c8905426ba3599eaf2c635be2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9159f26c8905426ba3599eaf2c635be2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9159f26c8905426ba3599eaf2c635be2"}}, "title": "The COVID-19 pandemic: consequences for nephrology.", "authors": [{"family": "Bruchfeld", "given": "Annette", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"title": "Nat Rev Nephrol", "issn": "1759-507X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1038/s41581-020-00381-4", "pmid": "33257872", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41581-020-00381-4"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:18:19.455Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:18:19.476Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7aeabc3750d1481bb578d56cb544837a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7aeabc3750d1481bb578d56cb544837a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7aeabc3750d1481bb578d56cb544837a"}}, "title": "Rapid review of suspected adverse drug events due to remdesivir in the WHO database; findings and implications.", "authors": [{"family": "Charan", "given": "Jaykaran", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kaur", "given": "Rimple Jeet", "initials": "RJ"}, {"family": "Bhardwaj", "given": "Pankaj", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Haque", "given": "Mainul", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sharma", "given": "Praveen", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Misra", "given": "Sanjeev", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Godman", "given": "Brian", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-30", "journal": {"title": "Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol", "issn": "1751-2441", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Objectives: Remdesivir has shown promise in the management of patients with COVID-19 although recent studies have shown concerns with its effectiveness in practice.

Methods: Interrogation of WHO VigiBase\u00ae from 2015 to 2020 coupled with published studies of ADEs in COVID-19 patients. The main outcome measures are the extent of ADEs broken down by factors including age, seriousness, region and organ. Results: A total 1086 ADEs were reported from the 439 individual case reports up to 19 July 2020 in the VigiBase\u00ae, reduced to 1004 once duplicates were excluded. Almost all ADEs concerned COVID-19 patients (92.5%), with an appreciable number from the Americas (67.7%). The majority of ADEs were from males > 45 years and were serious (82.5%). An increase in hepatic enzymes (32.1%), renal injury (14.4%), rise in creatinine levels (11.2%) respiratory failure (6.4%) were the most frequently reported ADEs.

However, these measures may also lead to increases in social isolation, loneliness, and stress, which can alter the consumption of pornography habits. The aim of the study was thus to explore the interest pattern in pornography and coronavirus-themed pornography during the COVID-19 outbreak. Google Trends\u00ae was employed to determine the most popular porn websites (Porn, XNXX, PornHub, xVideos, and xHamster), and coronavirus-themed pornography worldwide and in six nations with different COVID-19 outbreak and self-isolation recommendations. We analyzed every search trend on Google\u00ae from January 9, 2020 to May 25, 2020 using \"joint point regression analysis\". Comparisons of week relative search volume (WRSV) and temporal patterns were analyzed to assess the change of interest in search terms during nations lockdowns. Paired t-test was used to compare WRSV values among the porn websites during the national lockdowns and the equivalent timespan of the weeks in the previous 4 years. The research trend of almost every keyword increased with significant inflection points for those nations with a straight \"stay at home orders\" (China, Italy, Spain, and France). \"PornHub\" and \"Porn\" showed the highest increase of interest worldwide with an average weekend percentage change (AWPC) of 4.9 and 3.8, respectively. The mean WRSV for keywords in USA and Sweden did not show a similar increase as the other nations. The WRSV percentage change with the historical data had a peak during the straight nations' lockdowns (p < 0.01). All the nations had a significant increase in WRSV coronavirus-themed pornography for each keyword (p < 0.01) with an AWPC, ranging worldwide between 18.5 and 61.8 (p < 0.01), after the beginning of self-quarantine. As strengths this study uses a big data technology to collect worldwide trend of interest, however, data are anonymous and do not allow analysis of subpopulation groups. In conclusion, we demonstrated an increased interest in pornography and coronavirus-themed pornography after the outbreak of COVID-19 in nations with a straight \"stay at home orders\".", "doi": "10.1038/s41443-020-00380-w", "pmid": "33249423", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T07:47:06.936Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.239Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f2778adcd2b944c7983e61fdd7315dbf", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f2778adcd2b944c7983e61fdd7315dbf.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f2778adcd2b944c7983e61fdd7315dbf"}}, "title": "Mental health of Urban Mothers (MUM) study: a multicentre randomised controlled trial, study protocol.", "authors": [{"family": "Schwank", "given": "Simone Eliane", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Chung", "given": "Ho-Fung", "initials": "HF"}, {"family": "Hsu", "given": "Mandy", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Fu", "given": "Shih-Chien", "initials": "SC"}, {"family": "Du", "given": "Li", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Zhu", "given": "Liping", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Huang", "given": "Hsuan-Ying", "initials": "HY"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Ewa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Acharya", "given": "Ganesh", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-27", "journal": {"title": "BMJ Open", "issn": "2044-6055", "volume": "10", "issue": "11", "pages": "e041133", "issn-l": "2044-6055"}, "abstract": "Mental health disorders are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period and can have serious adverse effects on women and their children. The consequences for global mental health due to COVID-19 are likely to be significant and may have a long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Besides physical vulnerability, pregnant women are at increased risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the consequences of social distancing. It can result in altered healthcare routines, less support from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during prenatal visits, labour and delivery. Higher than expected, rates of perinatal anxiety and depression have been already reported during the pandemic. Pregnant women may also feel insecure and worried about the effects of COVID-19 on their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to using internet services frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression, reducing the risk of serious mental health disorders, and lead to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes.\n\nOur aim is to explore the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial peer-to-peer support intervention in reducing the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living in metropolitan urban settings.\n\nWe plan to conduct a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial, Mental health of Urban Mothers trial. Pregnant women living in large metropolitan cities will be recruited using internet-based application through non-profit organisations' websites. The women who consent will be randomised to receive a web-based peer-to-peer support intervention or usual care. Data will be analysed to identify the effects of intervention on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scores as well as pregnancy outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress will be assesed using Impact Event Scale-R. Any differences in outcomes between cities will be addressed in subgroup analyses.\n\nThe study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will follow the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Beyond slowing viral transmission, strict lockdowns have severe economic consequences. This work investigated response stringency, quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker's Stringency Index, and examined how restrictive interventions affected infection rates and gross domestic product (GDP) in China and OECD countries. Accounting for response timing, China imposed the most stringent restrictions, while Sweden and Japan were the least stringent. Expected GDP declines range from -8% (Japan) to -15.4% (UK). While greater restrictions generally slowed viral transmission, they failed to reach statistical significance and reduced GDP ( p = 0.006). Timing was fundamental: governments who responded to the pandemic faster saw greater reductions in viral transmission (p = 0.013), but worse decreases in GDP (p = 0.044). Thus, response stringency has a greater effect on GDP than infection rates, which are instead affected by the timing of COVID-19 interventions. Attempts to mitigate economic impacts by delaying restrictions or decreasing stringency may buoy GDP in the short term but increase infection rates, the longer-term economic consequences of which are not yet fully understood.

The three-dimensional microstructure of the material, a fuel cell gas diffusion layer, is acquired via X-ray computed tomography and used as input for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We perform a quantitative analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics, and we identify the dominant fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times, characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing number of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the pore invasion dynamics, and counteract the stabilising viscous force. Liquid transport is indeed affected by the presence of microstructure-induced capillary pressures acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary fingering transport mechanism and unstable front displacement, even in the absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects of the such a dynamic capillary pressure.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association between initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding.\r\n\r\nIn this retrospective study, all critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500-4500 IU tinzaparin or 2500-5000 IU dalteparin), medium (> 4500 IU but < 175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or > 5000 IU but < 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose (\u2265 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or \u2265 200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis.\r\n\r\nA total of 152 patients were included: 67 received low-, 48 medium-, and 37 high-dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. For patients who received high-dose prophylaxis, mortality was lower (13.5%) compared to those who received medium dose (25.0%) or low dose (38.8%), p = 0.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13-0.87) among those who received high dose, and 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43-1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared to those who received low-dose thromboprophylaxis.

The State of S\u00e3o Paulo failed to adopt an effective social distancing strategy, reaching at most 59% in late March and started to relax the measures in late June, dropping to 41% in 08 August. Therefore, S\u00e3o Paulo relies heavily on a massive testing strategy in the attempt to control the epidemic. Two alternative strategies combined with economic evaluations were simulated. One strategy included indiscriminately testing the entire population of the State, reaching more than 40 million people at a maximum cost of 2.25 billion USD, that would reduce the total number of cases by the end of 2020 by 90%. The second strategy investigated testing only symptomatic cases and their immediate contacts - this strategy reached a maximum cost of 150 million USD but also reduced the number of cases by 90%. The conclusion is that if the State of S\u00e3o Paulo had decided to adopt the simulated strategy on April the 1st, it would have been possible to reduce the total number of cases by 90% at a cost of 2.25 billion US dollars for the indiscriminate strategy but at a much smaller cost of 125 million US dollars for the selective testing of symptomatic cases and their contacts.", "doi": "10.1016/j.idm.2020.11.004", "pmid": "33235942", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2468-0427(20)30074-9"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7677040"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T10:28:12.415Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.137Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "20fd08edee8f451198a5e24ea3f85ab0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/20fd08edee8f451198a5e24ea3f85ab0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/20fd08edee8f451198a5e24ea3f85ab0"}}, "title": "Economic arguments in migrant health policymaking: proposing a research agenda.", "authors": [{"family": "Gottlieb", "given": "Nora", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Trummer", "given": "Ursula", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Davidovitch", "given": "Nadav", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Krasnik", "given": "Allan", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ju\u00e1rez", "given": "Sol P", "initials": "SP"}, {"family": "Rostila", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Biddle", "given": "Louise", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Bozorgmehr", "given": "Kayvan", "initials": "K"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-11-20", "journal": {"title": "Global Health", "issn": "1744-8603", "volume": "16", "issue": "1", "pages": "113", "issn-l": "1744-8603"}, "abstract": "Welfare states around the world restrict access to public healthcare for some migrant groups. Formal restrictions on migrants' healthcare access are often justified with economic arguments; for example, as a means to prevent excess costs and safeguard scarce resources. However, existing studies on the economics of migrant health policies suggest that restrictive policies increase rather than decrease costs. This evidence has largely been ignored in migration debates. Amplifying the relationship between welfare state transformations and the production of inequalities, the Covid-19 pandemic may fuel exclusionary rhetoric and politics; or it may serve as an impetus to reconsider the costs that one group's exclusion from health can entail for all members of society.The public health community has a responsibility to promote evidence-informed health policies that are ethically and economically sound, and to counter anti-migrant and racial discrimination (whether overt or masked with economic reasoning). Toward this end, we propose a research agenda which includes 1) the generation of a comprehensive body of evidence on economic aspects of migrant health policies, 2) the clarification of the role of economic arguments in migration debates, 3) (self-)critical reflection on the ethics and politics of the production of economic evidence, 4) the introduction of evidence into migrant health policymaking processes, and 5) the endorsement of inter- and transdisciplinary approaches.

The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be related to urbanization, habitat destruction, live animal trade, intensive livestock farming and global travel. The contribution of climate and air pollution requires additional studies. Importantly, the severity of COVID-19 depends on the interactions between the viral infection, ageing and chronic diseases such as metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and obesity which are themselves influenced by environmental stressors. The mechanisms of these interactions deserve additional scrutiny. Both the pandemic and the social response to the disease have elicited an array of behavioural and societal changes that may remain long after the pandemic and that may have long term health effects including on mental health.

However, we know from extensive studies of social networks that there is significant variation in the number of connections and thus social contacts each individual has. Individuals with more social contacts are more likely to attract and spread infection. These individuals are likely the drivers of the epidemic, so-called superspreaders. When many superspreaders are immune, it becomes more difficult for the disease to spread, as the connectedness of the social network dramatically decreases. If one assumes all individuals being equally connected and thus as likely to spread disease as in a SIR model, this is not true.\r\n\r\nMethods To account for the impact of social network structure on epidemic development, we model the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic preferential attachment graph which changes appearance proportional to observed mobility changes. We sample a serial interval distribution that determines the probability of dispersion for all infected nodes each day. We model the dispersion in different age groups using age-specific infection fatality rates. We vary the infection probabilities in different age groups and analyse the outcome.\r\n\r\nResults The impact of movement on network dynamics plays a crucial role in the spread of infections. We find that higher movement results in higher spread due to an increased probability of new connections being made within a social network. We show that saturation in the dispersion can be reached much earlier on a preferential attachment graph compared to spread on a random graph, which is more similar to estimations using R0.\r\n\r\nConclusions We provide a novel method for modelling epidemics by using a dynamic network structure related to observed mobility changes.

Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied whether such error would affect test sensitivity and/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1). Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR and/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG was verified by an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China/Healgen Scientific, LLC, U.S.A.]). Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than or equal to 900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI greater than or equal to 700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69/74; 95% CI: 85.1% - 97.1%) and 87.8% (65/74; 95% CI: 78.5% - 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93/100; 95% CI: 86.3% - 96.6%) and 100.0% for IgG (100/100; 95% CI: 96.3% - 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100% for IgM (200/200; 95% CI: 98.1% - 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199/200; 95% CI: 97.2% - 99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG. Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 specific IgM/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level.

Serological tests will improve our understanding of the infection and immunity in this population, unless the tests give false positive results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays with samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases collected before April 2019, thus defined as negative.\r\n\r\nMethods Samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and RF +/- systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10), were tested with 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed multiplex bead-based assay.\r\n\r\nResults Six LFA and the in-house IgG assay gave the correct negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal with samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in RF positive RA samples. MS samples did not give any false positive in any of the assays.\r\n\r\nConclusion The majority of the verified serological assays were sensitive to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and therefore may have poor specificity in this context.

symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the effect of ferric carboxymaltose, compared with placebo, on outcomes in patients who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure.\n\nAFFIRM-AHF was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial done at 121 sites in Europe, South America, and Singapore. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, were hospitalised for acute heart failure with concomitant iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <100 \u03bcg/L, or 100-299 \u03bcg/L with transferrin saturation <20%), and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%. Before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency. To maintain masking of patients and study personnel, treatments were administered in black syringes by personnel not involved in any study assessments. The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalisations for heart failure and cardiovascular death up to 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one post-randomisation data point. Secondary outcomes were the composite of total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; cardiovascular death; total heart failure hospitalisations; time to first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death; and days lost due to heart failure hospitalisations or cardiovascular death, all evaluated up to 52 weeks after randomisation. Safety was assessed in all patients for whom study treatment was started. A pre-COVID-19 sensitivity analysis on the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02937454, and has now been completed.\n\nBetween March 21, 2017, and July 30, 2019, 1525 patients were screened, of whom 1132 patients were randomly assigned to study groups. Study treatment was started in 1110 patients, and 1108 (558 in the carboxymaltose group and 550 in the placebo group) had at least one post-randomisation value. 293 primary events (57\u00b72 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 372 (72\u00b75 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the placebo group (rate ratio [RR] 0\u00b779, 95% CI 0\u00b762-1\u00b701, p=0\u00b7059). 370 total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 451 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0\u00b780, 95% CI 0\u00b764-1\u00b700, p=0\u00b7050). There was no difference in cardiovascular death between the two groups (77 [14%] of 558 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 78 [14%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b770-1\u00b732, p=0\u00b781). 217 total heart failure hospitalisations occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 294 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0\u00b774; 95% CI 0\u00b758-0\u00b794, p=0\u00b7013). The composite of first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death occurred in 181 (32%) patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 209 (38%) in the placebo group (HR 0\u00b780, 95% CI 0\u00b766-0\u00b798, p=0\u00b7030). Fewer days were lost due to heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death for patients assigned to ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo (369 days per 100 patient-years vs 548 days per 100 patient-years; RR 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b747-0\u00b797, p=0\u00b7035). Serious adverse events occurred in 250 (45%) of 559 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 282 (51%) of 551 patients in the placebo group.\n\nIn patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.\n\nVifor Pharma.", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32339-4", "pmid": "33197395", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0140-6736(20)32339-4"}, {"db": "ClinicalTrials.gov", "key": "NCT02937454"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T10:49:53.803Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T10:49:53.814Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "040cdb5e913f4417ba0f2d8f35bfc266", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/040cdb5e913f4417ba0f2d8f35bfc266.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/040cdb5e913f4417ba0f2d8f35bfc266"}}, "title": "Human soluble ACE2 improves the effect of remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "authors": [{"family": "Monteil", "given": "Vanessa", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Dyczynski", "given": "Matheus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lauschke", "given": "Volker M", "initials": "VM"}, {"family": "Kwon", "given": "Hyesoo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Wirnsberger", "given": "Gerald", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Youhanna", "given": "Sonia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Haibo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "S Slutsky", "given": "Arthur", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hurtado Del Pozo", "given": "Carmen", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Horn", "given": "Moritz", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Montserrat", "given": "Nuria", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Penninger", "given": "Josef M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Mirazimi", "given": "Ali", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-12", "journal": {"title": "EMBO Mol Med", "issn": "1757-4684", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "e13426", "issn-l": "1757-4676"}, "abstract": "There is a critical need for safe and effective drugs for COVID-19.

Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection.

At that time virus testing for COVID-19 was limited to patients with severe symptoms. Local differences in viral spread was shown by analyzing weekly composite samples of wastewater from five sampling sites for four weeks. The highest amount of virus was found from the central, eastern, and northern parts of the city. SARS-CoV-2 was also found in the treated effluent wastewater from the WWTP discharged into the recipient, the G\u00f6ta River, although with a reduction of 4-log 10. The viral peaks with regular temporal intervals indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may have a cluster spread, probably reflecting that the majority of infected persons only spread the disease during a few days.

The close agreement of NMR secondary structure determination of isolated RNA elements with DMS footprinting and NMR performed on larger RNA regions shows that the secondary structure elements fold independently.

In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (\"COVID-19-Pregnancy\"). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority.

Timely assessment of the severity of blood clotting will be of enormous help to clinicians in determining the right blood-thinning medications to prevent stroke or other life-threatening consequences. Therefore, rapid identification of blood-clotting-related proteins in the plasma of COVID-19 patients would save many lives. Several nanotechnology-based approaches are being developed to diagnose patients at high risk of death due to complications from COVID-19 infections, including blood clots. This Perspective outlines (i) the significant potential of nanomedicine in assessing the risk of blood clotting and its severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and (ii) its synergistic roles with advanced mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approaches in identifying the important protein patterns that are involved in the occurrence and progression of this disease.

Most of the RNA viruses causing illnesses in humans are of zoonotic origin. Zoonotic viruses can directly be transferred from animals to humans through adaptation, followed by human-to-human transmission, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or they can be transferred through insects or vectors, as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). At the present, there are no vaccines or antiviral compounds against most of these viruses. Because proteins possess a vast array of functions in all known biological systems, proteomics-based strategies can provide important insights into the investigation of disease pathogenesis and the identification of promising antiviral drug targets during an epidemic or pandemic. Mass spectrometry technology has provided the capacity required for the precise identification and the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of proteins on a large scale and has contributed greatly to unravelling key protein-protein interactions, discovering signaling networks, and understanding disease mechanisms.

The virus has already infected more than 44 M people and the number of deaths reported has reached more than 1.1 M which may be attributed to lack of medicine. The traditional drug discovery approach involves many years of rigorous research and development and demands for a huge investment which cannot be adopted for the ongoing pandemic infection. Rather we need a swift and cost-effective approach to inhibit and control the viral infection. With the help of computational screening approaches and by choosing appropriate chemical space, it is possible to identify lead drug-like compounds for Covid-19. In this study, we have used the Drugbank database to screen compounds against the most important viral targets namely 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the spike (S) protein. These targets play a major role in the replication/transcription and host cell recognition, therefore, are vital for the viral reproduction and spread of infection. As the structure based computational screening approaches are more reliable, we used the crystal structures for 3C-like main protease and spike protein. For the remaining targets, we used the structures based on homology modeling. Further, we employed two scoring methods based on binding free energies implemented in AutoDock Vina and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area approach. Based on these results, we propose drug cocktails active against the three viral targets namely 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. Interestingly, one of the identified compounds in this study i.e. Baloxavir marboxil has been under clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In addition, we have identified a few compounds such as Phthalocyanine, Tadalafil, Lonafarnib, Nilotinib, Dihydroergotamine, R-428 which can bind to all three targets simultaneously and can serve as multi-targeting drugs. Our study also included calculation of binding energies for various compounds currently under drug trials. Among these compounds, it is found that Remdesivir binds to targets, 3CLpro and RdRp with high binding affinity. Moreover, Baricitinib and Umifenovir were found to have superior target-specific binding while Darunavir is found to be a potential multi-targeting drug. As far as we know this is the first study where the compounds from the Drugbank database are screened against four vital targets of SARS-CoV-2 and illustrates that the computational screening using a double scoring approach can yield potential drug-like compounds against Covid-19 infection.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-020-75762-7", "pmid": "33154404", "labels": {"Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41598-020-75762-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7645721"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T14:46:02.174Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.559Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "cd7cc72539de42339a8adea9f3ffbed2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd7cc72539de42339a8adea9f3ffbed2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd7cc72539de42339a8adea9f3ffbed2"}}, "title": "Differences of SARS-CoV-2 serological test performance between hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases.", "authors": [{"family": "Wolf", "given": "Johannes", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kaiser", "given": "Thorsten", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Pehnke", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nickel", "given": "Olaf", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "L\u00fcbbert", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kalbitz", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Arnold", "given": "Benjamin", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Ermisch", "given": "J\u00f6rg", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Berger", "given": "Luisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Schroth", "given": "Stefanie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Isermann", "given": "Berend", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Borte", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Biemann", "given": "Ronald", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-05", "journal": {"title": "Clin Chim Acta", "issn": "1873-3492", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0009-8981"}, "abstract": "Serological severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays differ in the target antigen specificity, e.g. of antibodies directed against the viral spike or the nucleocapsid protein, and in the spectrum of detected immunoglobulins.

Identifying and supporting those most affected by the pandemic is required. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on individuals with tinnitus and to identify mediating factors. Methods: This is a mixed-methods exploratory cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online survey from 3,103 individuals with tinnitus from 48 countries. The greatest representation was from North America (49%) and Europe (47%) and other countries were only marginally represented. Results: Although the study was aimed at those with pre-existing tinnitus, 7 individuals reported having COVID-19 initiated tinnitus. Having COVID-19 symptoms exacerbated tinnitus in 40% of respondents, made no change in 54%, and improved tinnitus in 6%. Other mediating factors such as the social and emotional consequences of the pandemic made pre-existing tinnitus more bothersome for 32% of the respondents, particularly for females and younger adults, better for 1%, and caused no change to tinnitus for 67%. Pre-existing tinnitus was significantly exacerbated for those self-isolating, experiencing loneliness, sleeping poorly, and with reduced levels of exercise. Increased depression, anxiety, irritability, and financial worries further significantly contributed to tinnitus being more bothersome during the pandemic period. Conclusions: These findings have implications for tinnitus management, because they highlight the diverse response both internal and external factors have on tinnitus levels. Clinical services should be mindful that tinnitus may be caused by contracting COVID-19 and pre-existing tinnitus may be exacerbated, although in the majority of respondents there was no change. Additional support should be offered where tinnitus severity has increased due to the health, social, and/or emotional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tinnitus may be more bothersome for those experiencing loneliness, having fewer social interactions, and who are more anxious or worried.", "doi": "10.3389/fpubh.2020.592878", "pmid": "33251179", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7676491"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T08:25:37.374Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T08:25:37.386Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ab683807584e43508e269e9580f7d3ac", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ab683807584e43508e269e9580f7d3ac.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ab683807584e43508e269e9580f7d3ac"}}, "title": "Innate lymphoid cell composition associates with COVID-19 disease severity", "authors": [{"family": "Garc\u00eda", "given": "Marina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kokkinou", "given": "Efthymia", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Carrasco Garc\u00eda", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Parrot", "given": "Tiphaine", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Palma Medina", "given": "Laura M.", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Maleki", "given": "Kimia T.", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Christ", "given": "Wanda", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Varnait\u0117", "given": "Renata", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Filipovic", "given": "Iva", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ljunggren", "given": "Hans-Gustaf", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkstr\u00f6m", "given": "Niklas K.", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Folkesson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rooyackers", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Lars I.", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "S\u00f6nnerborg", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Gredmark-Russ", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Klingstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Mj\u00f6sberg", "given": "Jenny", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Group", "given": "the Karolinska KI/K COVID-19 Study", "initials": "tKKCS"}], "type": "posted-content", "published": "2020-11-04", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Objectives The role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is unknown.

The first diagnosis in Italy was on February 20, 2020, followed by the establishment of a light and a tight lockdown on February 23 and on March 8, 2020, respectively. The virus spread rapidly, particularly in the North of the country in the 'Padan Plain' area, known as one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Air pollution has been recently hypothesized to enhance the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting through adverse effects on immunity, induction of respiratory and other chronic disease, upregulation of viral receptor ACE-2, and possible pathogen transportation as a virus carrier. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates within two Italian regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). We estimated ground-level nitrogen dioxide through its tropospheric levels using data available from the Sentinel-5P satellites of the European Space Agency Copernicus Earth Observation Programme before the lockdown. We then examined COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the nitrogen dioxide levels at three 14-day lag points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, 2020. Using a multivariable negative binomial regression model, we found an association between nitrogen dioxide and COVID-19 mortality.

Adrenomedullin is a vasoactive hormone, with reported prognostic and potentially therapeutic value in sepsis. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association of circulating bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) levels at intensive care unit (ICU) admission with mortality in sepsis patients and in a general ICU population. Secondary aims included the association of bio-ADM with organ failure and the ability of bio-ADM to identify sepsis.\n\nIn this retrospective observational study, adult patients admitted to one of four ICUs during 2016 had admission bio-ADM levels analysed. Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI for log-2 transformed bio-ADM, and Youden's index derived cut-offs were calculated. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included the need for organ support and the ability to identify sepsis.\n\nBio-ADM in 1867 consecutive patients were analysed; 632 patients fulfilled the sepsis-3 criteria of whom 267 had septic shock. The median bio-ADM in the entire ICU population was 40 pg/mL, 74 pg/mL in sepsis patients, 107 pg/mL in septic shock and 29 pg/mL in non-septic patients. The association of elevated bio-ADM and mortality in sepsis patients and the ICU population resulted in ORs of 1.23 (95% CI 1.07-1.41) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.12-1.32), respectively. The association with mortality remained after additional adjustment for lactate in sepsis patients.

Based on these findings, we articulate some important learnings from the early stages of the COVID-19 European pandemic, and highlight key considerations for all countries' mental health services as the current pandemic develops and for future pandemics.", "doi": "10.1080/15622975.2020.1844290", "pmid": "33143529", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T14:50:54.093Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T14:50:54.114Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2ba162b83ed44bdcb5738acf41b3156e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2ba162b83ed44bdcb5738acf41b3156e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2ba162b83ed44bdcb5738acf41b3156e"}}, "title": "Global between-countries variance in SARS-CoV-2 mortality is driven by reported prevalence, age distribution, and case detection rate", "authors": [{"family": "Baba\u010di\u0107", "given": "Haris", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Lehti\u00f6", "given": "Janne", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Pernemalm", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}], "type": null, "published": "2020-11-04", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Objective: To explain the global between-countries variance in number of deaths per million citizens (nDpm) and case fatality rate (CFR) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design: Systematic analysis. Data sources: Worldometer, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, United Nations Main outcome measures: The explanators of nDpm and CFR were mathematically hypothesised and tested on publicly-available data from 88 countries with linear regression models on May 1st 2020. The derived explanators - age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFRadj) and case detection rate (CDR) - were estimated for each country based on a SARS-CoV-2 model of China. The accuracy and agreement of the models with observed data was assessed with R2 and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Sensitivity analyses involved removal of outliers and testing the models at five retrospective and two prospective time points. Results: Globally, IFRadj estimates varied between countries, ranging from below 0.2% in the youngest nations, to above 1.3% in Portugal, Greece, Italy, and Japan. The median estimated global CDR of SARS-CoV-2 infections on April 16th 2020 was 12.9%, suggesting that most of the countries have a much higher number of cases than reported. At least 93% and up to 99% of the variance in nDpm was explained by reported prevalence expressed as cases per million citizens (nCpm), IFRadj, and CDR. IFRadj and CDR accounted for up to 97% of the variance in CFR, but this model was less reliable than the nDpm model, being sensitive to outliers (R2 as low as 67.5%). Conclusions: The current differences in SARS-CoV-2 mortality between countries are driven mainly by reported prevalence of infections, age distribution, and CDR.

We describe the nature and context of the decision-making and analysed how doctors make intensive care admission decisions. Such decisions are complex with intrinsic uncertainty, often urgent and made with incomplete information. While doctors aspire to make patient-centred decisions, key challenges include: being overworked with lack of time; limited support from senior staff; and a lack of adequate staffing in other parts of the hospital that may be compromising patient safety. To reduce decision complexity, heuristic rules based on experience are often used to help think through the problem; for example, the patient's functional status or clinical gestalt. The intensive care doctors actively managed relationships with referring doctors; acted as the hospital generalist for acutely ill patients; and brought calm to crisis situations. However, they frequently failed to elicit values and preferences from patients or family members. They were rarely explicit in balancing burdens and benefits of intensive care for patients, so consistency and equity cannot be judged. The use of a framework for intensive care admission decisions that reminds doctors to seek patient or family views and encourages explicit balancing of burdens and benefits could improve decision-making.

The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19 and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein\u2013specific Ab-secreting cells in all 20 COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot Assay. Out of the 20 patients, 16 had developed SARS-CoV-2\u2013neutralizing Abs by the time of inclusion in the study. SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific IgA, IgG, and IgM Ab levels positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2\u2013neutralizing Ab titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific Ab levels may reflect the titers of neutralizing Abs in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of infection. Last, we showed that IL-6 and C-reactive protein serum concentrations were higher in patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting the recent observations that IL-6 and C-reactive protein could be used as markers for COVID-19 severity. Altogether, this study constitutes a detailed description of clinical and immunological parameters in 20 COVID-19 patients, with a focus on B cell and Ab responses, and describes tools to study immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.", "doi": "10.4049/jimmunol.2000717", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Data type: Protein data": null, "Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null, "Research Area: Host cell systems biology and targets": null, "Funder: VR: Special COVID-19 funding": null, "Funder: VR": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T14:50:45.425Z", "modified": "2020-12-04T08:27:51.548Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f55490e3a83d4d75b26c47c0548597a9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f55490e3a83d4d75b26c47c0548597a9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f55490e3a83d4d75b26c47c0548597a9"}}, "title": "International registry of otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons with COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Sowerby", "given": "Leigh J", "initials": "LJ"}, {"family": "Stephenson", "given": "Kate", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Dickie", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lella", "given": "Federico A Di", "initials": "FAD"}, {"family": "Jefferson", "given": "Niall", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "North", "given": "Hannah", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "De Siati", "given": "R Daniele", "initials": "RD"}, {"family": "Maunsell", "given": "Rebecca", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Herzog", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nandhan", "given": "Raghu", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Trozzi", "given": "Marilena", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Dehgani-Mobaraki", "given": "Puya", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Melkane", "given": "Antoine", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Callejas", "given": "Claudio", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Miljeteig", "given": "Harald", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Smit", "given": "Diane", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Reynoso", "given": "Daniel Dibildox", "initials": "DD"}, {"family": "Moura", "given": "Joao Eloi", "initials": "JE"}, {"family": "Hermansson", "given": "Ann", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Peer", "given": "Shazia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Burnell", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Fakhry", "given": "Nicolas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Chiesa-Estomba", "given": "Carlos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "\u00d6nerci \u00c7elebi", "given": "\u00d6zlem", "initials": "\u00d6"}, {"family": "Karpischenko", "given": "Sergei", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Sobol", "given": "Steven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Sargi", "given": "Zoukaa", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Patel", "given": "Zara M", "initials": "ZM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Int Forum Allergy Rhinol", "issn": "2042-6984", "volume": "10", "issue": "11", "pages": "1201-1208", "issn-l": "2042-6976"}, "abstract": "It has become clear that healthcare workers are at high risk, and otolaryngology has been theorized to be among the highest risk specialties for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

there is decreased capacity to see patients in the outpatient clinic and mHealth has become an important component of many AF outpatient clinics. Several validated mHealth solutions are available for remote heart rate and rhythm monitoring as well as for risk factor assessment. mHealth technologies can be used for (semi-)continuous longitudinal monitoring or for short-term on-demand monitoring, dependent on the respective requirements and clinical scenarios. As a possible solution to improve remote AF care through teleconsultation, we introduce the on-demand TeleCheck-AF mHealth approach that allows remote app-based assessment of heart rate and rhythm around teleconsultations, which has been developed and implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.\n\nLarge scale international mHealth projects, such as TeleCheck-AF, will provide insight into the additional value and potential limitations of mHealth strategies to remotely manage AF patients.

A suite of preventive behaviours have been recommended to minimize risk of COVID-19 infection in the general population. The present study utilized an integrated social cognition model to explain COVID-19 preventive behaviours in a sample from the Iranian general population.\n\nThe study adopted a three-wave prospective correlational design.\n\nMembers of the general public (N = 1,718, M age = 33.34, SD = 15.77, male = 796, female = 922) agreed to participate in the study. Participants completed self-report measures of demographic characteristics, intention, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and action self-efficacy at an initial data collection occasion. One week later, participants completed self-report measures of maintenance self-efficacy, action planning and coping planning, and, a further week later, measures of COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Hypothesized relationships among social cognition constructs and COVID-19 preventive behaviours according to the proposed integrated model were estimated using structural equation modelling.\n\nThe proposed model fitted the data well according to multiple goodness-of-fit criteria. All proposed relationships among model constructs were statistically significant. The social cognition constructs with the largest effects on COVID-19 preventive behaviours were coping planning (\u03b2 = .575, p < .001) and action planning (\u03b2 = .267, p < .001).\n\nCurrent findings may inform the development of behavioural interventions in health care contexts by identifying intervention targets. In particular, findings suggest targeting change in coping planning and action planning may be most effective in promoting participation in COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Curbing COVID-19 infections globally is vital to reduce severe cases and deaths in at-risk groups. Preventive behaviours like handwashing and social distancing can stem contagion of the coronavirus. Identifying modifiable correlates of COVID-19 preventive behaviours is needed to inform intervention. What does this study add? An integrated model identified predictors of COVID-19 preventive behaviours in Iranian residents. Prominent predictors were intentions, planning, self-efficacy, and perceived behavioural control. Findings provide insight into potentially modifiable constructs that interventions can target. Research should examine if targeting these factors lead to changes in COVID-19 behaviours over time.", "doi": "10.1111/bjhp.12465", "pmid": "32780891", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7436576"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T13:30:27.584Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.459Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c7b5d0c782d34b6b8e7f92788ee11cde", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c7b5d0c782d34b6b8e7f92788ee11cde.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c7b5d0c782d34b6b8e7f92788ee11cde"}}, "title": "COVID-19 puts the Sustainable Development Goals center stage.", "authors": [{"family": "Ottersen", "given": "Ole Petter", "initials": "OP"}, {"family": "Engebretsen", "given": "Eivind", "initials": "E"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Nat Med", "issn": "1546-170X", "issn-l": "1078-8956", "volume": "26", "issue": "11", "pages": "1672-1673"}, "abstract": "Correspondence", "doi": "10.1038/s41591-020-1094-y", "pmid": "33037423", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41591-020-1094-y"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:24:14.636Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:24:43.108Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "c16a784427d3471e850b91eee6e6a91d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c16a784427d3471e850b91eee6e6a91d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/c16a784427d3471e850b91eee6e6a91d"}}, "title": "Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: Early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy.", "authors": [{"family": "Mastellos", "given": "Dimitrios C", "initials": "DC"}, {"family": "Pires da Silva", "given": "Bruno G P", "initials": "BGP"}, {"family": "Fonseca", "given": "Benedito A L", "initials": "BAL"}, {"family": "Fonseca", "given": "Natasha P", "initials": "NP"}, {"family": "Auxiliadora-Martins", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mastaglio", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ruggeri", "given": "Annalisa", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sironi", "given": "Marina", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Radermacher", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Chrysanthopoulou", "given": "Akrivi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Skendros", "given": "Panagiotis", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Ritis", "given": "Konstantinos", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Manfra", "given": "Ilenia", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Iacobelli", "given": "Simona", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Huber-Lang", "given": "Markus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Bo", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Yancopoulou", "given": "Despina", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Connolly", "given": "E Sander", "initials": "ES"}, {"family": "Garlanda", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Ciceri", "given": "Fabio", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Risitano", "given": "Antonio M", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Calado", "given": "Rodrigo T", "initials": "RT"}, {"family": "Lambris", "given": "John D", "initials": "JD"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Clin Immunol", "issn": "1521-7035", "issn-l": "1521-6616", "volume": "220", "issue": null, "pages": "108598"}, "abstract": "Growing clinical evidence has implicated complement as a pivotal driver of COVID-19 immunopathology. Deregulated complement activation may fuel cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby leading to multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) may elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we compare the efficacy of the C5-targeting monoclonal antibody eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, marked lung function improvement, and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID-19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, attenuated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, faster serum LDH decline, and more prominent lymphocyte recovery. These early clinical results offer important insights into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19 and point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways in thromboinflammation. They also support the evaluation of these complement-targeting agents as COVID-19 therapeutics in large prospective trials.", "doi": "10.1016/j.clim.2020.108598", "pmid": "32961333", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Funder: VR: Special COVID-19 funding": null, "Funder: VR": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S1521-6616(20)30758-0"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7501834"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS1630767"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:51:36.660Z", "modified": "2020-12-04T09:07:37.162Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "bdb516f3c98f4f7098054985e3b15024", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/bdb516f3c98f4f7098054985e3b15024.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/bdb516f3c98f4f7098054985e3b15024"}}, "title": "Will coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have an impact on antimicrobial resistance?", "authors": [{"family": "Monnet", "given": "Dominique L", "initials": "DL"}, {"family": "Harbarth", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "45", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.45.2001886", "pmid": "33183403", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7667630"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T16:27:06.332Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T16:27:06.344Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b0eb6187940d41ffbfe6bc0ce016018e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b0eb6187940d41ffbfe6bc0ce016018e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b0eb6187940d41ffbfe6bc0ce016018e"}}, "title": "Early impact of COVID-19 on individuals with self-reported eating disorders: A survey of ~1,000 individuals in the United States and the Netherlands.", "authors": [{"family": "Termorshuizen", "given": "Jet D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Watson", "given": "Hunna J", "initials": "HJ"}, {"family": "Thornton", "given": "Laura M", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Borg", "given": "Stina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Flatt", "given": "Rachael E", "initials": "RE"}, {"family": "MacDermod", "given": "Casey M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Harper", "given": "Lauren E", "initials": "LE"}, {"family": "van Furth", "given": "Eric F", "initials": "EF"}, {"family": "Peat", "given": "Christine M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Bulik", "given": "Cynthia M", "initials": "CM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Int J Eat Disord", "issn": "1098-108X", "volume": "53", "issue": "11", "pages": "1780-1790", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We evaluated the early impact of COVID-19 on people with self-reported eating disorders.\n\nParticipants in the United States (US, N = 511) and the Netherlands (NL, N = 510), recruited through ongoing studies and social media, completed an online survey that included both quantitative measures and free-text responses assessing the impact of COVID-19 on situational circumstances, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder treatment, and general well-being.\n\nResults revealed strong and wide-ranging effects on eating disorder concerns and illness behaviors that were consistent with eating disorder type.

Evidence shows that up to a fifth of the patients develop fibrotic tissue in the lung. The SARS outbreak in the early 2000 resulted in chronic pulmonary fibrosis in a subset (around 4%) of the patients, and correlated to reduced lung function and forced expiratory volume (FEV). The similarities between corona virus infections causing SARS and Covid-19 are striking, except that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has proven to have an even higher communicability. This would translate into a large number of patients seeking care for clinical signs of pulmonary fibrosis, given that the Covid-19 pandemic has up till now (Sept 2020) affected around 30 million people. The SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Downregulation of ACE2 upon virus binding disturbs downstream activities of RAS resulting in increased inflammation and development of fibrosis. The poor prognosis and risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis are therefore associated with the increased expression of ACE2 in risk groups, such as obesity, heart disorders and aging, conferring plenty of binding opportunity for the virus and subsequently the internalization of ACE2, thus devoiding the enzyme from acting counter-inflammatory and antifibrotic. Identifying pathways that are associated with Covid-19 severity that result in pulmonary fibrosis may enable early diagnosis and individualized treatment for these patients to prevent or reduce irreversible fibrotic damage to the lung.", "doi": "10.1016/j.yrmex.2020.100023", "pmid": "33083782", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2590-1435(20)30010-5"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7546672"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:49:56.303Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T11:49:56.325Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a107d4a9a1434c93ba1cbee8a5c6ca16", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a107d4a9a1434c93ba1cbee8a5c6ca16.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a107d4a9a1434c93ba1cbee8a5c6ca16"}}, "title": "Risks to healthcare workers following tracheal intubation of patients with COVID-19: a prospective international multicentre cohort study.", "authors": [{"family": "El-Boghdadly", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wong", "given": "D J N", "initials": "DJN"}, {"family": "Owen", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Neuman", "given": "M D", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Pocock", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Carlisle", "given": "J B", "initials": "JB"}, {"family": "Johnstone", "given": "C", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Andruszkiewicz", "given": "P", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Baker", "given": "P A", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "Biccard", "given": "B M", "initials": "BM"}, {"family": "Bryson", "given": "G L", "initials": "GL"}, {"family": "Chan", "given": "M T V", "initials": "MTV"}, {"family": "Cheng", "given": "M H", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Chin", "given": "K J", "initials": "KJ"}, {"family": "Coburn", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jonsson Fagerlund", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Myatra", "given": "S N", "initials": "SN"}, {"family": "Myles", "given": "P S", "initials": "PS"}, {"family": "O'Sullivan", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pasin", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Shamim", "given": "F", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "van Klei", "given": "W A", "initials": "WA"}, {"family": "Ahmad", "given": "I", "initials": "I"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-11-00", "journal": {"title": "Anaesthesia", "issn": "1365-2044", "volume": "75", "issue": "11", "pages": "1437-1447", "issn-l": "0003-2409"}, "abstract": "Healthcare workers involved in aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheal intubation, may be at elevated risk of acquiring COVID-19.

a drug commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has received much negative publicity for adverse events associated with its authorisation for emergency use to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I2 value was less than 0\u00b74.\n\nThe study included 956 374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310 350 users of sulfasalazine, 323 122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351 956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1\u00b765 [95% CI 1\u00b712-2\u00b744]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2\u00b719 [95% CI 1\u00b722-3\u00b795]), chest pain or angina (1\u00b715 [1\u00b705-1\u00b726]), and heart failure (1\u00b722 [1\u00b702-1\u00b745]).\n\nHydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term.

Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death.\n\nBetween March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47-66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44-84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0\u00b7106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0\u00b7837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p<0\u00b70001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p<0\u00b70001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0\u00b7046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1\u00b74% [95% CI -7\u00b77 to 10\u00b74]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1\u00b706 [95% CI 1\u00b701 to 1\u00b711] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1\u00b757 [1\u00b705 to 2\u00b736] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18\u00b730 [1\u00b796 to 170\u00b775]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients.\n\nLiver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were.

The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) formed a panel of experts to develop consensus recommendations on the implications of the pandemic on several aspects of cancer care in this age group including geriatric assessment (GA), surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, palliative care and research. Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In selected cases, this might require deferring or omitting surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatments especially where benefits are marginal and alternative safe therapeutic options are available.

Contrary to our predictions, the observed partisan gap strengthened over time and remained when stay-at-home orders were active. Additionally, county-level consumption of conservative media (Fox News) was related to reduced physical distancing.

Faced with a situation that creates disjuncture, the person is compelled to find new knowledge and new ways of doing things; i.e., he/she must embark on a learning process. The recent introduction of social distancing as a measure aiming to reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus has dramatically changed people's behaviour, but this measure does not only have preventive and desirable effects. There is an associated risk for increased isolation among the older generations of the population, as well as a change in intergenerational relationships. Although the current pandemic (as disjuncture) may potentially initiate major learning processes in the human collective, we should remember that disjuncture is often theorised within neutral, or even positive, contexts. In a context of fear, however, learning may result in a narrowing of mindsets and a rejection of collective efforts and solidarity between generations. In terms of the types of learning triggered by the current pandemic (as disjuncture), one problem is non-reflective learning, which primarily occurs on a behavioural level. We need to recognise this and engage in reflective learning if we are to make the choices that will lead to a society that is worth living in for all generations. Our goal must be to learn to be a person in a post-pandemic society.", "doi": "10.1007/s11159-020-09863-w", "pmid": "33144741", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "9863"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7596631"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T14:49:36.708Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T14:49:48.354Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "3a127f769d8a486b86f9abc60a8625b6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3a127f769d8a486b86f9abc60a8625b6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/3a127f769d8a486b86f9abc60a8625b6"}}, "title": "Pfam: The protein families database in 2021.", "authors": [{"family": "Mistry", "given": "Jaina", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Chuguransky", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Williams", "given": "Lowri", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Qureshi", "given": "Matloob", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Salazar", "given": "Gustavo A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Sonnhammer", "given": "Erik L L", "initials": "ELL"}, {"family": "Tosatto", "given": "Silvio C E", "initials": "SCE"}, {"family": "Paladin", "given": "Lisanna", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Raj", "given": "Shriya", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Richardson", "given": "Lorna J", "initials": "LJ"}, {"family": "Finn", "given": "Robert D", "initials": "RD"}, {"family": "Bateman", "given": "Alex", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-30", "journal": {"title": "Nucleic Acids Res", "issn": "1362-4962", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0305-1048"}, "abstract": "The Pfam database is a widely used resource for classifying protein sequences into families and domains.

With the outbreak of CoVID-19 pandemic, strict social isolation measures have been necessary to prevent the spreading of the disease. Effects of this lockdown period on behavior, mood and cognition in people with DS have not been assessed so far. In the present clinical study, we investigated the impact of CoVID-19-related lockdown on psychosocial, cognitive and functional well-being in a sample population of 46 adults with DS. The interRAI Intellectual Disability standardized assessment instrument, which includes measures of social withdrawal, functional impairment, aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms, was used to perform a three time-point evaluation (two pre-lockdown and one post-lockdown) in 37 subjects of the study sample, and a two time point evaluation (one pre- and one post-lockdown) in 9 subjects. Two mixed linear regression models - one before and one after the lockdown - have been fitted for each scale in order to investigate the change in the time-dependent variation of the scores. In the pre-lockdown period, significant worsening over time (i.e., per year) was found for the Depression Rating Scale score (\u03b2 = 0.55; 95% CI 0.34; 0.76). In the post-lockdown period, a significant worsening in social withdrawal (\u03b2 = 3.05, 95% CI 0.39; 5.70), instrumental activities of daily living (\u03b2 = 1.13, 95% CI 0.08; 2.18) and depression rating (\u03b2 = 1.65, 95% CI 0.33; 2.97) scales scores was observed, as was a significant improvement in aggressive behavior (\u03b2 = -1.40, 95% CI -2.69; -0.10). Despite the undoubtful importance of the lockdown in order to reduce the spreading of the CoVID-19 pandemic, the related social isolation measures suggest an exacerbation of depressive symptoms and a worsening in functional status in a sample of adults with DS. At the opposite, aggressive behavior was reduced after the lockdown period. This finding could be related to the increase of negative and depressive symptoms in the study population.

The overall number and percentage of exfoliative and fine-needle aspiration cytology samples from each anatomic site were recorded. Differences in the malignancy and suspicious rates between the 2 periods were analyzed using a meta-analytical approach.\n\nOverall, the sample volume was lower compared with 2019 (104,319 samples vs 190,225 samples), with an average volume reduction of 45.3% (range, 0.1%-98.0%). The percentage of samples from the cervicovaginal tract, thyroid, and anorectal region was significantly reduced (P < .05). Conversely, the percentage of samples from the urinary tract, serous cavities, breast, lymph nodes, respiratory tract, salivary glands, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and biliary tract increased (P < .05).

Jordan has implemented strict nationwide control measures to halt the viral spread, one of which was the closure of universities and shifting to remote teaching.

Our study aimed at assessing 1) psychological status, 2) challenges of distance teaching, and 3) coping activities and pandemic-related concerns among university teachers in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19-related quarantine and control measures. We conducted a cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using a validated Arabic version of the Kessler Distress Scale (K10). Other information collected included sociodemographic profile, methods used to handle distress, motivation to participate in distance teaching, and challenges of distance teaching as well as the most worrisome issues during this pandemic. Three hundred eighty-two university teachers returned completed surveys. Results of K10 showed that 31.4% of respondents had severe distress and 38.2% had mild to moderate distress. Whereas gender was not associated with distress severity, age had a weak negative correlation (Rho = -0.19, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, most teachers had moderate to high motivation for distance teaching. Engagement with family was the most reported self-coping activity. More than half of the participants were most concerned and fearful about SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is greater emphasis on allowing patients access to remote therapies.

Themes discussed include the importance of training, supervision, creating support documents/manuals, and record keeping. Alongside this are communication strategies used by therapists to encourage patient adherence and treatment effectiveness. These include rapport building, treatment personalization, and suggestions for overcoming non-engagement. These reflections offer important considerations for the delivery of iCBTs as well as implications associated with the implementation of these interventions in existing services and future research studies.

Non-invasive strategies should first optimize body position with reverse Trendelenburg position or sitting position. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is considered as the first-line therapy in patients with obesity having a postoperative acute respiratory failure. Positive pressure pre-oxygenation before the intubation procedure is the method of reference. The use of videolaryngoscopy has to be considered by adequately trained intensivists, especially in patients with several risk factors. Regarding mechanical ventilation in patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), low tidal volume (6 ml/kg of predicted body weight) and moderate to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with careful recruitment maneuver in selected patients, are advised. Prone positioning is a therapeutic choice in severe ARDS patients with obesity. Prophylactic NIV should be considered after extubation to prevent re-intubation. If obesity increases mortality and risk of ICU admission in the overall population, the impact of obesity on ICU mortality is less clear and several confounding factors have to be taken into account regarding the \"obesity ICU paradox\".", "doi": "10.1007/s00134-020-06286-x", "pmid": "33095284", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s00134-020-06286-x"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7582031"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:47:55.408Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T15:34:43.643Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a25e4faab1cd435db55f17485fb41713", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a25e4faab1cd435db55f17485fb41713.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a25e4faab1cd435db55f17485fb41713"}}, "title": "Potential Neurological Manifestations of COVID-19: A Narrative Review.", "authors": [{"family": "Pergolizzi", "given": "Joseph V", "initials": "JV"}, {"family": "Raffa", "given": "Robert B", "initials": "RB"}, {"family": "Varrassi", "given": "Giustino", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Magnusson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "LeQuang", "given": "Jo Ann", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Paladini", "given": "Antonella", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Taylor", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Wollmuth", "given": "Charles", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Breve", "given": "Frank", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Chopra", "given": "Maninder", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nalamasu", "given": "Rohit", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Christo", "given": "Paul J", "initials": "PJ"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-22", "journal": {"title": "Postgrad Med", "issn": "1941-9260", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0032-5481"}, "abstract": "Neurological manifestations are increasingly reported in a subset of COVID-19 patients. Previous infections related to coronaviruses, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) also appeared to have neurological effects on some patients. The viruses associated with COVID-19 like that of SARS enters the body via the ACE-2 receptors in the central nervous system, which causes the body to balance an immune response against potential damage to non-renewable cells. A few rare cases of neurological sequalae of SARS and MERS have been reported. A growing body of evidence is accumulating that COVID-19, particularly in severe cases, may have neurological consequences although respiratory symptoms nearly always develop prior to neurological ones. Patients with pre-existing neurological conditions may be at elevated risk for COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms. Neurological reports in COVID-19 patients have described encephalopathy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myopathy, neuromuscular disorders, encephalitis, cephalgia, delirium, critical illness polyneuropathy, and others. Treating neurological symptoms can pose clinical challenges as drugs that suppress immune response may be contraindicated in COVID-19 patients. It is possible that in some COVID-19 patients, neurological symptoms are being overlooked or misinterpreted.

As Covid-19 demonstrates, human health needs to be understood holistically, meaning that the vulnerability of any individuals, or even nations, is a vulnerability for the whole population requiring urgent action.", "doi": "10.3389/fpubh.2020.574334", "pmid": "33194974", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7604301"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:01:13.351Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T11:03:47.779Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "70d4934c27434293805e8ae5fb7722b4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/70d4934c27434293805e8ae5fb7722b4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/70d4934c27434293805e8ae5fb7722b4"}}, "title": "Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 train machine learning to assign likelihood of past infection during virus emergence in Sweden", "authors": [{"family": "Castro Dopico", "given": "Xaqu\u00edn", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Hanke", "given": "Leo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Sheward", "given": "Daniel J.", "initials": "DJ"}, {"family": "Muschiol", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Christian", "given": "Murray", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Grinberg", "given": "Nastasiya F.", "initials": "NF"}, {"family": "Adori", "given": "Monika", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Perez Vidakovics", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "ChangIl", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Khoenkhoen", "given": "Sharesta", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Pushparaj", "given": "Pradeepa", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Moliner Morro", "given": "Ainhoa", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mandolesi", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Ahl", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Forsell", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Coquet", "given": "Jonathan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Corcoran", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rorbach", "given": "Joanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Dillner", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bogdanovic", "given": "Gordana", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "McInerney", "given": "Gerald", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Allander", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wallace", "given": "Chris", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Murrell", "given": "Ben", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Albert", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Karlsson Hedestam", "given": "Gunilla B.", "initials": "GB"}], "type": null, "published": "2020-10-19", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Serology is critical for understanding pathogen-specific immune responses, but is fraught with difficulty, not least because the strength of antibody (Ab) response varies greatly between individuals and mild infections generally generate lower Ab titers (1-3).

Reindeer herding products are used as traditional nutrition, and as effective preventive means and remedies for adapting to the cold and geomagnetic activity in the High North. Export trends of traditional reindeer products have decreased local Indigenous peoples' access to venison and had a negative impact on their health. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is especially urgent for the Indigenous peoples to have sufficient access to traditional food and be involved in policy decision-making to maintain this traditional business. We aim to analyze the dependencies of Indigenous peoples on the reindeer produce-exporting \"food value chain\" and explore how (1) the independence of reindeer herders could be increased in these export chains and (2) how provision of their products to local communities could be secured. The study takes a multidisciplinary approach based on policy and socioeconomic analyses with input from medical research.

The primary aim of this study was to test whether rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) at admission indicates hypercoagulopathy and predicts the disease severity, assessed as care level, in COVID-19 patients. The study was designed as a prospective, observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: (1) regular wards or (2) wards with specialized ventilation support. Conventional coagulation tests, blood type and ROTEM were taken at admission. 60 patients were included; age 61 (median), 67% men, many with comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with in patients at regular wards (p < 0.05).

Indeed, patients with asthma and allergy appear underrepresented in large reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In this review, we evaluate existing literature on this topic and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between asthma and COVID-19.\n\nData from several preclinical and clinical reports suggest a lower susceptibility for COVID-19 in patients with underlying type 2 airway inflammation including asthma that may be related to a reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Corticosteroids further decrease expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, hence may also have a protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some studies suggest that the reported improvement in asthma control and a reduction in asthma exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic may be related to improvement in adherence to controller therapy and reduced exposure to triggers, such as other respiratory viruses and air pollutants. Recent data point towards differential susceptibility for COVID-19 among asthma patients based on their phenotype and/or endotype. On the basis of existing evidence, continuation with controller therapies is recommended for all patients with asthma. For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, adjustment of controllers and biologics should be based on a multidisciplinary decision.\n\nUnderrepresentation of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with asthma and related allergic diseases may be based on potentially protective underlying mechanisms, such as type 2 airway inflammation, downregulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptors, reduced exposures to triggers and improved adherence to controller medications.

These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO 2 tropospheric levels using satellite data available at the European Space Agency before the lockdown. Using a multivariable restricted cubic spline regression model, we compared NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence rate at different time points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, in the 28 provinces of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. We found little association of NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence up to about 130 \u03bcmol/m2, while a positive association was evident at higher levels at each time point. Notwithstanding the limitations of the use of aggregated data, these findings lend some support to the hypothesis that high levels of air pollution may favor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140278", "pmid": "32758963", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0048-9697(20)33799-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7297152"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T15:43:31.840Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T15:43:31.851Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e8e888fa0a634256b20d6587ef48b94c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e8e888fa0a634256b20d6587ef48b94c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e8e888fa0a634256b20d6587ef48b94c"}}, "title": "Global impact of COVID-19 on non-communicable disease management: descriptive analysis of access to FRAX fracture risk online tool for prevention of osteoporotic fractures.", "authors": [{"family": "McCloskey", "given": "E V", "initials": "EV"}, {"family": "Harvey", "given": "N C", "initials": "NC"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Lorentzon", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Vandenput", "given": "L", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Liu", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kanis", "given": "J A", "initials": "JA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-14", "journal": {"title": "Osteoporos Int", "issn": "1433-2965", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, and its management, is markedly impacting the management of osteoporosis as judged by access to online FRAX fracture risk assessments. Globally, access was 58% lower in April than in February 2020. Strategies to improve osteoporosis care, with greater use of fracture risk assessments, offer a partial solution.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant detrimental impact on the management of chronic diseases including osteoporosis. We have quantified the global impact by examining changes in the usage of online FRAX fracture risk assessments before and after the declaration of the pandemic (11 March 2020).\n\nThe study comprised a retrospective analysis using GoogleAnalytics data on daily sessions on the FRAX\u00ae website ( www.sheffield.ac.uk/FRAX ) from November 2019 to April 2020 (main analysis period February-April 2020), and the geographical source of that activity.\n\nOver February-April 2020, the FRAX website recorded 460,495 sessions from 184 countries, with 210,656 sessions in February alone. In March and April, the number of sessions fell by 23.1% and 58.3% respectively, a pattern not observed over the same period in 2019. There were smaller reductions in Asia than elsewhere, partly related to earlier and less-marked nadirs in some countries (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Vietnam). In Europe, the majority of countries (24/31, 77.4%) reduced usage by at least 50% in April. Seven countries showed smaller reductions (range - 2.85 to - 44.1%) including Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Finland. There was no significant relationship between the reduction in FRAX usage and measures of disease burden such as COVID-attributed deaths per million of the population.\n\nThis study documents a marked global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of osteoporosis as reflected by FRAX online fracture risk assessments.

As a result, due to the destruction of nitric oxide ( \u2022NO) by inflammatory superoxide (O2\u2022-), pulmonary \u2022NO concentration ceases, resulting in uncontrolled platelet aggregation and massive thrombosis, which kills the patients. Introducing \u2022NO by inhalation (INO) may replace the loss of endothelium-derived \u2022NO. The first results from clinical trials with INO in SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rapid and sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function and decreased inflammation. An ongoing phase III study is expected to confirm the method's efficacy. INO may hence become a first line treatment in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, due to the rapid inactivation of \u2022NO by deoxyhemoglobin to nitrate, pulmonary administration of \u2022NO will not protect remote organs. Another INO-related pharmacological approach to protect SARS-CoV-2 patients from developing life-threatening disease is to inhibit the O2\u2022--driven destruction of \u2022NO by neutralizing inflammatory O2\u2022-. By making use of low molecular weight compounds that mimic the action of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The MnSOD mimetics of the so-called porphyrin type (e.g., AEOL 10150), salen type (e.g., EUK-8) and cyclic polyamine type (e.g., M40419, today known as GC4419 and avasopasem manganese) have all been shown to positively affect the inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells in preclinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Manganese diPyridoxyL EthylDiamine (MnPLED)-type mangafodipir (manganese dipyridoxyl diphosphate-MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that possesses MnSOD mimetic activity, has shown promising results in various forms of inflammation, in preclinical as well as clinical settings. Intravenously administration of mangafodipir will, in contrast to INO, reach remote organs and may hence become an important supplement to INO. From the authors' viewpoint, it appears logical to test mangafodipr in COVID-19 patients at risk of developing life-threatening SARS-CoV-2.

Hence there is a marked knowledge gap that requires urgent attention. Therefore, in this systematic review, viability/stability of airborne SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses is discussed.\n\nA systematic literature review was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus to assess the stability and viability of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on air samples.\n\nThe initial search identified 27 articles. Following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates, 11 articles were considered relevant. Temperatures ranging from 20 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C and relative humidity ranging from 40% to 50% were reported to have a protective effect on viral viability for airborne SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As no data is yet available on the conditions influencing viability for airborne SARS-CoV-2, and given the genetic similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, one could extrapolate that the same conditions would apply. Nonetheless, the effect of these conditions seems to be residual considering the increasing number of cases in the south of USA, Brazil and India, where high temperatures and humidities have been observed.\n\nHigher temperatures and high relative humidity can have a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viability in the environment, as reported in previous studies to this date. However, these studies are experimental, and do not support the fact that the virus has efficiently spread in the tropical regions of the globe, with other transmission routes such as the contact and droplet ones probably being responsible for the majority of cases reported in these regions, along with other factors such as human mobility patterns and contact rates. Further studies are needed to investigate the extent of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as this would have important implications for public health and infection-control policies.", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142802", "pmid": "33071145", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0048-9697(20)36331-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7543729"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T11:51:35.091Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:05:19.632Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7c590b4e9a234f918c74726c082da341", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7c590b4e9a234f918c74726c082da341.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7c590b4e9a234f918c74726c082da341"}}, "title": "Living with the COVID-19 pandemic: act now with the tools we have.", "authors": [{"family": "Bedford", "given": "Juliet", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Enria", "given": "Delia", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Giesecke", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Heymann", "given": "David L", "initials": "DL"}, {"family": "Ihekweazu", "given": "Chikwe", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kobinger", "given": "Gary", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lane", "given": "H Clifford", "initials": "HC"}, {"family": "Memish", "given": "Ziad A", "initials": "ZA"}, {"family": "Oh", "given": "Myoung-Don", "initials": "MD"}, {"family": "Sall", "given": "Amadou Alpha", "initials": "AA"}, {"family": "Ungchusak", "given": "Kumnuan", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Wieler", "given": "Lothar H", "initials": "LH"}, {"family": "WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-08", "journal": {"title": "Lancet", "issn": "1474-547X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0140-6736"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32117-6", "pmid": "33038947", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0140-6736(20)32117-6"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7544497"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:21:13.505Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:21:13.515Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6b71d3289aed493a916aaaca1fbb2ea6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6b71d3289aed493a916aaaca1fbb2ea6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6b71d3289aed493a916aaaca1fbb2ea6"}}, "title": "What every Researcher should know about Searching - Clarified Concepts, Search Advice, and an Agenda to improve Finding in Academia.", "authors": [{"family": "Gusenbauer", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Haddaway", "given": "Neal R", "initials": "NR"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-08", "journal": {"title": "Res Synth Methods", "issn": "1759-2887", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "We researchers have taken searching for information for granted for far too long.

This COVID-19 information crisis is indicative of the broader problem of information overloaded academic research. To improve our finding capabilities, we urgently need to improve how we search and the systems we use. We respond to Klopfenstein and Dampier (Res Syn Meth. 2020) who commented on our 2020 paper and proposed a way of improving PubMed's and Google Scholar's search functionalities. Our response puts their commentary in a larger frame and suggests how we can improve academic searching altogether. We urge that researchers need to understand that search skills require dedicated education and training. Better and more efficient searching requires an initial understanding of the different goals that define the way searching needs to be conducted. We explain the main types of searching that we academics routinely engage in; distinguishing lookup, exploratory, and systematic searching. These three types must be conducted using different search methods (heuristics) and using search systems with specific capabilities. To improve academic searching, we introduce the \"Search Triangle\" model emphasizing the importance of matching goals, heuristics, and systems. Further, we suggest an urgently needed agenda toward search literacy as the norm in academic research and fit-for-purpose search systems.", "doi": "10.1002/jrsm.1457", "pmid": "33031639", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:31:05.757Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:31:05.783Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "64e939415762403c9009f86ec14f76ef", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/64e939415762403c9009f86ec14f76ef.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/64e939415762403c9009f86ec14f76ef"}}, "title": "Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in COVID-19-related encephalopathy.", "authors": [{"family": "Muccioli", "given": "Lorenzo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Pensato", "given": "Umberto", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Bernab\u00e8", "given": "Giorgia", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ferri", "given": "Lorenzo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Tappat\u00e0", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Volpi", "given": "Lilia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Cani", "given": "Ilaria", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Henry", "given": "Olivia J", "initials": "OJ"}, {"family": "Ceccaroni", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Cevoli", "given": "Sabina", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Stofella", "given": "Gloria", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Pasini", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Fornaro", "given": "Giacomo", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Tonon", "given": "Caterina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Vidale", "given": "Simone", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Liguori", "given": "Rocco", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Tinuper", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Michelucci", "given": "Roberto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Cortelli", "given": "Pietro", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Bisulli", "given": "Francesca", "initials": "F"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-08", "journal": {"title": "J Neurol", "issn": "1432-1459", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "To report on efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy in a case series of patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy.\n\nWe retrospectively collected data on all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at two Italian hospitals who developed encephalopathy during disease course and were treated with IVIg.\n\nFive patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19.

COVID-19 patients have been majority male in the US and Spain, but predominantly female in South Korea. Age profiles vary across data sources. Compared to 84,585 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, COVID-19 patients have more typically been male, younger, and with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use.

We aimed to describe the worldwide COVID-19 clinical research response and its evolution over the first 100 days of the pandemic. Methods: Descriptive analysis of planned, ongoing or completed trials by April 9, 2020 testing any intervention to treat or prevent COVID-19, systematically identified in trial registries, preprint servers, and literature databases. A survey was conducted of all trials to assess their recruitment status up to July 6, 2020. Results: Most of the 689 trials (overall target sample size 396,366) were small (median sample size 120; interquartile range [IQR] 60-300) but randomized (75.8%; n=522) and were often conducted in China (51.1%; n=352) or the USA (11%; n=76). 525 trials (76.2%) planned to include 155,571 hospitalized patients, and 25 (3.6%) planned to include 96,821 health-care workers. Treatments were evaluated in 607 trials (88.1%), frequently antivirals (n=144) or antimalarials (n=112); 78 trials (11.3%) focused on prevention, including 14 vaccine trials. No trial investigated social distancing. Interventions tested in 11 trials with >5,000 participants were also tested in 169 smaller trials (median sample size 273; IQR 90-700). Hydroxychloroquine alone was investigated in 110 trials. While 414 trials (60.0%) expected completion in 2020, only 35 trials (4.1%; 3,071 participants) were completed by July 6. Of 112 trials with detailed recruitment information, 55 had recruited <20% of the targeted sample; 27 between 20-50%; and 30 over 50% (median 14.8% [IQR 2.0-62.0%]). Conclusions: The size and speed of the COVID-19 clinical trials agenda is unprecedented. However, most trials were small investigating a small fraction of treatment options. The feasibility of this research agenda is questionable, and many trials may end in futility, wasting research resources. Much better coordination is needed to respond to global health threats.", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.26707.2", "pmid": "33082937", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7539080.2"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-19T19:33:08.731Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.302Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ea5eacb93e4747ee98374542036f42a9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea5eacb93e4747ee98374542036f42a9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea5eacb93e4747ee98374542036f42a9"}}, "title": "Nitric oxide dosed in short bursts at high concentrations may protect against Covid 19.", "authors": [{"family": "Hedenstierna", "given": "G\u00f6ran", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Luni", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Hedenstierna", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Lieberman", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Fine", "given": "David H", "initials": "DH"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"title": "Nitric Oxide", "issn": "1089-8611", "volume": "103", "issue": null, "pages": "1-3", "issn-l": "1089-8603"}, "abstract": "It has long been suggested that NO may inhibit an early stage in viral replication. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Despite smoking being listed as a risk factor to contract Covid-19, only a low proportion of the smokers suffered from SARS-corona infection in China 2003, and from Covid-19 in China, Europe and the US. We hypothesize, that the intermittent bursts of high NO concentration in cigarette smoke may be a mechanism in protecting against the virus. Mainstream smoke from cigarettes contains NO at peak concentrations of between about 250 ppm and 1350 ppm in each puff as compared to medicinal use of no more than 80 to a maximum of 160 ppm. The diffusion of NO through the cell wall to reach the virus should be significantly more effective at the very high NO concentration in the smoke, according to classic laws of physics. The only oxide of nitrogen in the mainstream smoke is NO, and the NO 2 concentration that is inhaled is very low or undetectable, and methemoglobin levels are lower in smokers than non-smokers, reasonably explained by the breaths of air in between the puffs that wash out the NO. Specialized iNO machines can now be developed to provide the drug intermittently in short bursts at high concentration dose, which would then provide both a preventative drug for those at high risk, as well as an effective treatment, without the health hazards associated with smoking.", "doi": "10.1016/j.niox.2020.06.005", "pmid": "32590117", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type:

Data will be analysed descriptively and univariate associations between personal and organisational factors explored. This will help identify important factors related to awareness, knowledge, attitudes, belief and skills likely to affect future implementation of a decision support tool for the early detection of infection in nursing home residents.\n\nThis study was approved using the self-certification process at the University of Surrey and Link\u00f6ping University ethics committee (Approval 2018/514-32) in 2018. Study findings will be disseminated through community/stakeholder/service user engagement events in each country, publication in academic peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations. A LAY summary will be provided to participants who indicate they would like to receive this information.This is the first stage of a plan of work to revise and evaluate the Early Detection of Infection Scale (EDIS) tool and its effect on managing infections and reducing unplanned hospital admissions in nursing home residents.

The use of cloth masks for general public use is being debated, and is in flux. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and Google for articles reporting the filtration properties of flat cloth or cloth masks. We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles to identify further articles and identified articles through social and conventional news media. We found 25 articles. Study of protection for the wearer used healthy volunteers, or used a manikin wearing a mask, with airflow to simulate different breathing rates. Studies of protection of the environment, also known as source control, used convenience samples of healthy volunteers. The design and execution of the studies was generally rigorously described. Many descriptions of cloth lacked the detail required for reproducibility; no study provided all the expected details of material, thread count, weave, and weight. Some of the homemade mask designs were reproducible. Successful masks were made of muslin at 100 threads per inch (TPI) in 3 to 4 layers (4-layer muslin or a muslin-flannel-muslin sandwich), tea towels (also known as dish towels), made using 1 layer (2 layers would be expected to be better), and good-quality cotton T-shirts in 2 layers (with a stitched edge to prevent stretching). In flat-cloth experiments, linen tea towels, 600-TPI cotton in 2 layers, and 600-TPI cotton with 90-TPI flannel performed well but 80-TPI cotton in 2 layers did not. We therefore recommend cotton or flannel at least 100 TPI, at least 2 layers. More layers, 3 or 4, will provide increased filtration but there is a trade-off in that more layers increases the resistance to breathing. Although this is not a systematic review, we included all the articles that we identified in an unbiased way. We did not include gray literature or preprints.

The host response to the virus is equally complex and studies are now beginning to unravel the immunological correlates of COVID-19. Nanotechnology can be applied for the delivery of antiviral drugs or other repurposed drugs. Moreover, recent work has shown that synthetic nanoparticles wrapped with host-derived cellular membranes may prevent virus infection.

Preliminary evidence from these patients, as well as past coronavirus epidemics, indicates that those infected suffer from disproportionate complement activation as well as excessive coagulation, leading to thrombotic complications and poor outcome. In non-coronavirus cohorts, evidence has accumulated of an interaction between the complement and coagulation systems, with one amplifying activation of the other. A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade? In this review, we summarize the literature on thrombotic complications in COVID-19, complement activation in coronavirus infections, and the crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems. We demonstrate how the complement system is able to activate the coagulation cascade and platelets, inhibit fibrinolysis and stimulate endothelial cells.

keep the Health Care Professionals (HCP) safe taking care of patients may be limited, especially during the outbreak of a new disease. In particular, the face and body protective equipment is critical to prevent the wearer from exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates. This situation has been now observed worldwide during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As concern over shortages of PPE at hospitals grows, we share with the public and makers' community the Pressure Optimized PowEred Respirator (PROPER) equipment, made out of COTS components. It is functionally equivalent to a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR). PROPER, a hood-based system which uses open source and easily accessible components is low-cost, relatively passive in terms of energy consumption and mechanisms, and easy and fast to 3D print, build and assemble. We have adapted our experience on building clean room environments and qualifying the bioburden of space instruments to this solution, which is in essence a miniaturized, personal, wearable cleanroom. PROPER would be able to offer better protection than an N95 respirator mask, mainly because it is insensitive to seal fit and it shields the eyes as well. The PROPER SMS fabric is designed for single-use and not intended for reuse, as they may start to tear and fail but the rest of the parts can be disinfected and reused. We provide a set of guidelines to build a low-cost 3D printed solution for an effective PAPR system and describe the procedures to validate it to comply with the biosafety level 3 requirements. We have validated the prototype of PROPER unit for air flow, ISO class cleanliness level, oxygen and carbon-dioxide gas concentrations during exhalation, and present here these results for illustration. We demonstrate that the area inside the hood is more than 200 times cleaner than the external ambient without the operator and more than 175 times with the operator and in an aerosol exposed environment. We also include the procedure to clean and disinfect the equipment for reuse. PROPER may be a useful addition to provide protection to HCPs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus or other potential future viral diseases that are transmitted aerially.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00144", "pmid": "33043172", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S2468-0672(20)30053-5"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7536593"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T17:19:47.076Z", "modified": "2020-12-01T17:19:47.101Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a6f02b3fa3814e92b4279055100a2c89", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a6f02b3fa3814e92b4279055100a2c89.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a6f02b3fa3814e92b4279055100a2c89"}}, "title": "Pediatric transplantation in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic: Early impact on activity and healthcare.", "authors": [{"family": "Don\u00e1", "given": "Daniele", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Torres Canizales", "given": "Juan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Benetti", "given": "Elisa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Cananzi", "given": "Mara", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "De Corti", "given": "Federica", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Calore", "given": "Elisabetta", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hierro", "given": "Loreto", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ramos Boluda", "given": "Esther", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Melgosa Hijosa", "given": "Marta", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Garcia Guereta", "given": "Luis", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Barrios", "given": "Maribel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Costa Reis", "given": "Patricia", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Teixeira", "given": "Ana", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lopes", "given": "Maria Francelina", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Kalici\u0144ski", "given": "Piotr", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Branchereau", "given": "Sophie", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Boyer", "given": "Olivia", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Debray", "given": "Dominque", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Sciveres", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Wennberg", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Fischler", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Barany", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Baker", "given": "Alastair", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Baumann", "given": "Ulrich", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Schwerk", "given": "Nicolaus", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nicastro", "given": "Emanuele", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Candusso", "given": "Manila", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Toporski", "given": "Jacek", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sokal", "given": "Etienne", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Stephenne", "given": "Xavier", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Lindemans", "given": "Caroline", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Miglinas", "given": "Marius", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rascon", "given": "Jelena", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Jara", "given": "Paloma", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "ERN TransplantChild", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Clin Transplant", "issn": "1399-0012", "volume": "34", "issue": "10", "pages": "e14063", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has required an unusual allocation of resources that can negatively impact chronically ill patients and high-complexity procedures.

The replies of 30 professionals from 18 centers in Europe were collected. Twelve of 18 centers (67%) showed a reduction in their usual transplant activity. Additionally, outpatient visits have been modified and restricted to selected ones, and the use of telemedicine tools has increased. Additionally, a total of 14 COVID-19 pediatric transplanted patients were identified at the time of the survey, including eight transplant recipients and six candidates for transplantation. Only two moderate-severe cases were reported, both in HSCT setting. These survey results demonstrate the limitations in healthcare resources for pediatric transplantation patients during early stages of this pandemic.

This disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has developed into a pandemic. To date, it has resulted in ~9 million confirmed cases and caused almost 500 000 related deaths worldwide. Unequivocally, the COVID-19 pandemic is the gravest health and socioeconomic crisis of our time. In this context, numerous questions have emerged in demand of basic scientific information and evidence-based medical advice on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Although the majority of the patients show a very mild, self-limiting viral respiratory disease, many clinical manifestations in severe patients are unique to COVID-19, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia, a \"cytokine storm\" leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, endothelitis, thromboembolic complications, and multiorgan failure. The epidemiologic features of COVID-19 are distinctive and have changed throughout the pandemic. Vaccine and drug development studies and clinical trials are rapidly growing at an unprecedented speed. However, basic and clinical research on COVID-19-related topics should be based on more coordinated high-quality studies. This paper answers pressing questions, formulated by young clinicians and scientists, on SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and allergy, focusing on the following topics: virology, immunology, diagnosis, management of patients with allergic disease and asthma, treatment, clinical trials, drug discovery, vaccine development, and epidemiology.

Despite the great effort put in the development of vaccines and specific treatments, no prophylaxis or effective therapeutics are currently available. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and a potent vasodilator that has proved to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV replication and hypoxia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Given the potential of NO as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of NO on SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, while the non S-nitrosated NAP was not active, as expected. Although the viral replication was not completely abolished (at 200 \u03bcM and 400 \u03bcM), SNAP delayed or completely prevented the development of viral cytopathic effect in treated cells, and the observed protective effect correlated with the level of inhibition of the viral replication. The capacity of the NO released from SNAP to covalently bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL recombinant protease in vitro was also tested. The observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 protease activity was consistent with S-nitrosation of the enzyme active site cysteine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2020.101734", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Imaging data": null, "Data type: Protein data": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Research Area: Drug discovery and repurposing of drugs": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101734", "description": "Supplementary data"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:25:59.730Z", "modified": "2020-12-02T13:14:43.361Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "75c67caf246e413986c2d887261bb7d2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/75c67caf246e413986c2d887261bb7d2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/75c67caf246e413986c2d887261bb7d2"}}, "title": "Epidemic and pandemic viral infections: impact on tuberculosis and the lung: A consensus by the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN), and members of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC).", "authors": [{"family": "Ong", "given": "Catherine Wei Min", "initials": "CWM"}, {"family": "Migliori", "given": "Giovanni Battista", "initials": "GB"}, {"family": "Raviglione", "given": "Mario", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "MacGregor-Skinner", "given": "Gavin", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sotgiu", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Alffenaar", "given": "Jan-Willem", "initials": "JW"}, {"family": "Tiberi", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Adlhoch", "given": "Cornelia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Alonzi", "given": "Tonino", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Archuleta", "given": "Sophia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Brusin", "given": "Sergio", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Cambau", "given": "Emmanuelle", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Capobianchi", "given": "Maria Rosaria", "initials": "MR"}, {"family": "Castilletti", "given": "Concetta", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Centis", "given": "Rosella", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Cirillo", "given": "Daniela M", "initials": "DM"}, {"family": "D'Ambrosio", "given": "Lia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Delogu", "given": "Giovanni", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Esposito", "given": "Susanna M R", "initials": "SMR"}, {"family": "Figueroa", "given": "Jose", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Friedland", "given": "Jon S", "initials": "JS"}, {"family": "Ho", "given": "Benjamin Choon Heng", "initials": "BCH"}, {"family": "Ippolito", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Jankovic", "given": "Mateja", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Hannah Yejin", "initials": "HY"}, {"family": "Rosales Klintz", "given": "Senia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "K\u00f6dm\u00f6n", "given": "Csaba", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lalle", "given": "Eleonora", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Leo", "given": "Yee Sin", "initials": "YS"}, {"family": "Leung", "given": "Chi-Chiu", "initials": "CC"}, {"family": "M\u00e4rtson", "given": "Anne-Grete", "initials": "AG"}, {"family": "Melazzini", "given": "Mario Giovanni", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Najafi Fard", "given": "Saeid", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Penttinen", "given": "Pasi", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Petrone", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Petruccioli", "given": "Elisa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pontali", "given": "Emanuele", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Saderi", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Santin", "given": "Miguel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Spanevello", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "van Crevel", "given": "Reinout", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "van der Werf", "given": "Marieke J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Visca", "given": "Dina", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Viveiros", "given": "Miguel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Zellweger", "given": "Jean-Pierre", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Zumla", "given": "Alimuddin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Goletti", "given": "Delia", "initials": "D"}], "type": "consensus development conference", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Eur Respir J", "issn": "1399-3003", "volume": "56", "issue": "4", "issn-l": "0903-1936"}, "abstract": "Major epidemics, including some that qualify as pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 and most recently COVID-19, affect the lung.

The aim of this consensus-based document is to describe the effects of viral infections resulting in epidemics and pandemics that affect the lung (MERS, SARS, HIV, influenza A (H1N1)pdm/09 and COVID-19) and their interactions with TB. A search of the scientific literature was performed. A writing committee of international experts including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Public Health Emergency (ECDC PHE) team, the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), the Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN), and members of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Study Group for Mycobacterial Infections (ESGMYC) was established. Consensus was achieved after multiple rounds of revisions between the writing committee and a larger expert group. A Delphi process involving the core group of authors (excluding the ECDC PHE team) identified the areas requiring review/consensus, followed by a second round to refine the definitive consensus elements. The epidemiology and immunology of these viral infections and their interactions with TB are discussed with implications for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of airborne infections (infection control, viral containment and workplace safety).

Seven electronic databases were searched to April 6, 2020, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or nonrandomized prospective studies in the field. Study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment were performed for all included studies, while the outcome of interest pertained to differences in bacterial load quantification through the use of different interventions prior to aerosol-generating procedures in dental practices. Random effects frequentist network meta-analysis was performed, with mean difference (MD) and 95% CI as the effect measure. Confidence in the documented evidence was assessed through the newly fueled CINeMA framework (Confidence in Network Meta-analysis) based on the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Twenty-nine clinical trials were deemed eligible, 21 RCTs and 8 nonrandomized studies, while 11 RCTs contributed to the network meta-analysis, comprising 10 competing interventions. Tempered chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2% as compared with nonactive control mouth rinse, prior to routine ultrasonic scaling, was most effective toward reduced postprocedural bacterial load with an MD of -0.92 (95% CI, -1.54 to -0.29) in log 10 bacterial CFUs (colony-forming units). For CHX 0.2%, an MD of -0.74 (95% CI, -1.07 to -0.40) was observed as compared with control. Tempered CHX 0.2% presented the highest probabilities of being ranked the most effective treatment (31.2%). Level of confidence varied from very low to moderate across all formulated comparisons.

Which lessons can we learn? We identified relevant publications (until 26 July 2020) using systematic searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid EMBASE with predefined search strings. A total of 4571 unique publications were retrieved, out of which 378 publications were selected for in-depth analysis by two raters, including a total of 17549 (out of which were 14418 SARS-CoV-2) patients. Neurological complications and associated neuroradiological manifestations are prevalent for all HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2). Moreover there are similarities in symptomatology across different HCoVs, particularly between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Common neurological manifestations include fatigue, headache, and smell/taste disorders. Additionally, clinicians need to be attentive for at least five classes of neurological complications: (1) Cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke and macro/micro-hemorrhages, (2) encephalopathies, (3) para-/postinfectious immune-mediated complications such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, (4) (meningo-)encephalitis, potentially with concomitant seizures, and (5) neuropsychiatric complications such as psychosis and mood disorders. Our systematic review highlights the need for vigilance regarding neurological complications in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoVs, especially since some complications may result in chronic disability.

Under such circumstances, individuals with the features of cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, and metacognitive beliefs in negative thoughts may suffer more fears than those without these features. Therefore, the present study proposed a model to understand the associations between problematic internet use (PIU), cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19. Utilizing a cross-sectional online survey, 651 Iranians completed the following psychometric scales: Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Anxiety Sensitivity Questionnaire (ASI), Cyberchondria Severity Scale-Short Form (CSS-12), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale (GPIUS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the proposed model via several fit indices. The indices include Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The fit indices (CFI = 0.948, TLI = 0.938, RMSEA = 0.053, and SRMR = 0.001) indicated the good fit between the data and the proposed model. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 was significantly and directly predicted by cyberchondria (\u03b2 = 0.479, p < .001) and anxiety sensitivity (\u03b2 = 0.286, p < .001). The relationship between PIU and cyberchondria with fear of COVID-19 was mediated significantly by anxiety sensitivity and metacognitive beliefs.

Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach. Presented pros and cons, knowledge gaps and methods to identify lysosomotropic antivirals, can help in the evaluation of many drugs currently in clinical trials considered for repurposing to target COVID-19, as well as open doors to finding more potent and safer alternatives.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110582", "pmid": "32763818", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0753-3322(20)30775-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7392152"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:31:26.600Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:42:55.516Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "4796c127b3264e32a6831ad545b0ff92", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4796c127b3264e32a6831ad545b0ff92.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/4796c127b3264e32a6831ad545b0ff92"}}, "title": "Comprehensive investigation of an in-hospital transmission cluster of a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive physician among patients and healthcare workers in Germany.", "authors": [{"family": "Wendt", "given": "Ralph", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Nagel", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Nickel", "given": "Olaf", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Wolf", "given": "Johannes", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kalbitz", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kaiser", "given": "Thorsten", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Borte", "given": "Stephan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "L\u00fcbbert", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}], "type": "case reports", "published": "2020-10-00", "journal": {"title": "Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol", "issn": "1559-6834", "volume": "41", "issue": "10", "pages": "1209-1211", "issn-l": "0899-823X"}, "abstract": "We investigated potential transmissions of a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive physician in a tertiary-care hospital who worked for 15 cumulative hours without wearing a face mask.

We conducted analyses by docking the compounds against two SARS-CoV-2-specific targets: (1) the receptor binding domain spike protein and (2) the main protease of the virus (MPro) using the Schr\u00f6dinger software. Importantly, the docking analysis revealed that doxycycline (DOX) showed the most effective binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, whereas halofantrine and mefloquine bound effectively with the main protease among the antimalarial drugs evaluated in the present study. The in silico approach reported here suggested that DOX could potentially be a good candidate for repurposing for COVID-19. In contrast, to decipher the actual potential of DOX and halofantrine against COVID-19, further in vitro and in vivo studies are called for.

Moreover, it is likely that the inflammaging phenotype associated with age could both influence vaccination efficacy and exacerbate the risk of COVID-19-related \"cytokine storm syndrome\" with an overlap between the factors which impact vaccination effectiveness and those that boost virulence and worsen the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The complex and still unclear immunopathological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the progressive age-related decline of immune responses, and the lack of clear correlates of protection, make the design of vaccination strategies for older people extremely challenging.

Nevertheless, each year 800,000 people die of suicide in the world. While there is evidence indicating that suicide rates de-crease during times of crises, they are expected to increase once the immediate crisis has passed. The COVID-19 pandemic affects risk and pro-tective factors for suicide at each level of the socio-ecological model. Economic downturn, augmented barriers to accessing health care, increased access to suicidal means, inappropriate media reporting at the societal level; deprioritization of mental health and preventive activities at the community level; interpersonal conflicts, neglect and violence at the relationship level; unemployment, poverty, loneliness and hopelessness at the individual level: all these variables contribute to an increase of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, harmful use of alcohol, substance abuse, and ultimately suicide risk. Suicide should be prevented by strengthening universal strategies directed to the entire population, including mitigation of unemployment, poverty and inequalities; prioritization of access to mental health care; responsible media reporting, with information about available support; prevention of increased alcohol intake; and restriction of access to lethal means of suicide. Selective interventions should continue to target known vulnerable groups who are socio-economically disadvantaged, but also new ones such as first responders and health care staff, and the bereaved by COVID-19 who have been deprived of the final contact with loved ones and funerals. Indicated preventive strategies targeting individuals who display suicidal behaviour should focus on available pharmacological and psychological treatments of mental disorders, ensuring proper follow-up and chain of care by increased use of telemedicine and other digital means. The scientific community, health care professionals, politicians and decision-makers will find in this paper a systematic description of the effects of the pandemic on suicide risk at the society, community, family and individual levels, and an overview of how evidence-based suicide preventive interventions should be adapted.

We aimed to assess the number of institutional births, their outcomes (institutional stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate), and quality of intrapartum care before and during the national COVID-19 lockdown in Nepal.\n\nIn this prospective observational study, we collected participant-level data for pregnant women enrolled in the SUSTAIN and REFINE studies between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, from nine hospitals in Nepal. This period included 12\u00b75 weeks before the national lockdown and 9\u00b75 weeks during the lockdown. Women were eligible for inclusion if they had a gestational age of 22 weeks or more, a fetal heart sound at time of admission, and consented to inclusion. Women who had multiple births and their babies were excluded. We collected information on demographic and obstetric characteristics via extraction from case notes and health worker performance via direct observation by independent clinical researchers. We used regression analyses to assess changes in the number of institutional births, quality of care, and mortality before lockdown versus during lockdown.\n\nOf 22 907 eligible women, 21 763 women were enrolled and 20 354 gave birth, and health worker performance was recorded for 10 543 births. From the beginning to the end of the study period, the mean weekly number of births decreased from 1261\u00b71 births (SE 66\u00b71) before lockdown to 651\u00b74 births (49\u00b79) during lockdown-a reduction of 52\u00b74%. The institutional stillbirth rate increased from 14 per 1000 total births before lockdown to 21 per 1000 total births during lockdown (p=0\u00b70002), and institutional neonatal mortality increased from 13 per 1000 livebirths to 40 per 1000 livebirths (p=0\u00b70022). In terms of quality of care, intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring decreased by 13\u00b74% (-15\u00b74 to -11\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001), and breastfeeding within 1 h of birth decreased by 3\u00b75% (-4\u00b76 to -2\u00b76; p=0\u00b70032). The immediate newborn care practice of placing the baby skin-to-skin with their mother increased by 13\u00b72% (12\u00b71 to 14\u00b75; p<0\u00b70001), and health workers' hand hygiene practices during childbirth increased by 12\u00b79% (11\u00b78 to 13\u00b79) during lockdown (p<0\u00b70001).\n\nInstitutional childbirth reduced by more than half during lockdown, with increases in institutional stillbirth rate and neonatal mortality, and decreases in quality of care. Some behaviours improved, notably hand hygiene and keeping the baby skin-to-skin with their mother. An urgent need exists to protect access to high quality intrapartum care and prevent excess deaths for the most vulnerable health system users during this pandemic period.\n\nGrand Challenges

The decline in vehicular density on roads and congestion leads to reduced energy consumption and associated greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants emission.

All consecutive acute admissions to emergency departments and cardiology departments throughout a 1-month period during the COVID-19 outbreak were compared with an equivalent 1-month period in 2019. The acute admissions to cardiology departments were classified into 5 major categories: acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, and other.\n\nData from 54,331 patients were collected and analyzed. Nine centers provided data on acute admissions to emergency departments comprising 50,384 patients: 20,226 in 2020 compared with 30,158 in 2019 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] with 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.66 [0.58-0.76]).

We found a relatively higher percentage of pulmonary embolism admissions in 2020: odds ratio (95% CI): 1.5 (1.1-2.1), P = 0.02. Among patients with acute coronary syndrome, there were fewer admissions with unstable angina: 0.79 (0.66-0.94); non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction: 0.56 (0.50-0.64); and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: 0.78 (0.68-0.89).\n\nIn the European centers during the COVID-19 outbreak, there were fewer acute cardiovascular admissions.

At implantation, the endometrial stroma, glands, arteries and immune cells undergo anatomical and functional transformation to create the decidua, the specialized secretory endometrium of pregnancy. The maternal decidua and the invading fetal trophoblast constitute a dynamic junction that facilitates a complex immunological dialogue between the two. The decidual and peripheral immune systems together assume a pivotal role in regulating the critical balance between tolerance and defense against infection. Throughout pregnancy, this equilibrium is repeatedly subjected to microbial challenge. Acute viral infection in pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of adverse consequences for both mother and fetus. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus can cause developmental anomalies, growth restriction, preterm birth and stillbirth, while the mother is predisposed to heightened morbidity and maternal death. A rapid, effective response to invasive pathogens is therefore essential in order to avoid overwhelming maternal infection and consequent fetal compromise. This sentinel response is mediated by the innate immune system: a heritable, highly evolutionarily conserved system comprising physical barriers, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and a variety of immune cells-principally neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells-which express pattern-receptors that detect invariant molecular signatures unique to pathogenic micro-organisms. Recognition of these signatures during acute infection triggers signaling cascades that enhance antimicrobial properties such as phagocytosis, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of the complement system. As well as coordinating the initial immune response, macrophages and dendritic cells present microbial antigens to lymphocytes, initiating and influencing the development of specific, long-lasting adaptive immunity. Despite extensive progress in unraveling the immunological adaptations of pregnancy, pregnant women remain particularly susceptible to certain acute viral infections and continue to experience mortality rates equivalent to those observed in pandemics several decades ago. Here, we focus specifically on the pregnancy-induced vulnerabilities in innate immunity that contribute to the disproportionately high maternal mortality observed in the following acute viral infections: Lassa fever, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue fever, hepatitis E, influenza, and novel coronavirus infections.", "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2020.572567", "pmid": "33101294", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7556209"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:26:42.810Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T11:47:54.134Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "37842769c6394a15b1f9ad6e57ec202a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/37842769c6394a15b1f9ad6e57ec202a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/37842769c6394a15b1f9ad6e57ec202a"}}, "title": "Updated guidance on the management of COVID-19: from an American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society coordinated International Task Force (29 July 2020).", "authors": [{"family": "Bai", "given": "Chunxue", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Chotirmall", "given": "Sanjay H", "initials": "SH"}, {"family": "Rello", "given": "Jordi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Alba", "given": "George A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Ginns", "given": "Leo C", "initials": "LC"}, {"family": "Krishnan", "given": "Jerry A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Rogers", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bendstrup", "given": "Elisabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Burgel", "given": "Pierre-Regis", "initials": "PR"}, {"family": "Chalmers", "given": "James D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Chua", "given": "Abigail", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Crothers", "given": "Kristina A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Duggal", "given": "Abhijit", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Yeon Wook", "initials": "YW"}, {"family": "Laffey", "given": "John G", "initials": "JG"}, {"family": "Luna", "given": "Carlos M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Niederman", "given": "Michael S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Raghu", "given": "Ganesh", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ramirez", "given": "Julio A", "initials": "JA"}, {"family": "Riera", "given": "Jordi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Roca", "given": "Oriol", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Tamae-Kakazu", "given": "Maximiliano", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Torres", "given": "Antoni", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Watkins", "given": "Richard R", "initials": "RR"}, {"family": "Barrecheguren", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Belliato", "given": "Mirko", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Chami", "given": "Hassan A", "initials": "HA"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Rongchang", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Cortes-Puentes", "given": "Gustavo A", "initials": "GA"}, {"family": "Delacruz", "given": "Charles", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Hayes", "given": "Margaret M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Heunks", "given": "Leo M A", "initials": "LMA"}, {"family": "Holets", "given": "Steven R", "initials": "SR"}, {"family": "Hough", "given": "Catherine L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Jagpal", "given": "Sugeet", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Jeon", "given": "Kyeongman", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Johkoh", "given": "Takeshi", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Lee", "given": "May M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Liebler", "given": "Janice", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "McElvaney", "given": "Gerry N", "initials": "GN"}, {"family": "Moskowitz", "given": "Ari", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Oeckler", "given": "Richard A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Ojanguren", "given": "I\u00f1igo", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "O'Regan", "given": "Anthony", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pletz", "given": "Mathias W", "initials": "MW"}, {"family": "Rhee", "given": "Chin Kook", "initials": "CK"}, {"family": "Schultz", "given": "Marcus J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Storti", "given": "Enrico", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Strange", "given": "Charlie", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Thomson", "given": "Carey C", "initials": "CC"}, {"family": "Torriani", "given": "Francesca J", "initials": "FJ"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Xun", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Wuyts", "given": "Wim", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Xu", "given": "Tao", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Yang", "given": "Dawei", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Ziqiang", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Wilson", "given": "Kevin C", "initials": "KC"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-30", "journal": {"title": "Eur Respir Rev", "issn": "1600-0617", "volume": "29", "issue": "157", "issn-l": "0905-9180"}, "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2.

Little is known about whether social distancing and other societal changes has provoked an increase in gambling, whether decreased betting opportunities due to paused sports events spurred gamblers to transition to online casino gambling, or whether any of these factors have had an impact on problem gambling. Methods: Data on lookup queries against the Swedish Gambling Paus registry, logging all initiated gambling sessions by all licensed gambling providers, from 2019-01-01 (start of registry) to 2020-04-08 (well into the first phase of the outbreak) were analyzed using TBATS time series forecasting to estimate trends after the first domestic COVID-19 death. Obfuscated data on daily total wagered and deposited amounts, split by modality (casino or betting, and low and high intensity, respectively) for the equivalent period were supplied by a licensed online gambling provider. Results: Total gambling activity decreased by 13.29% during the first phase of the outbreak compared to forecast. Analyses of online gambling data revealed that although betting decreased substantially in synchrony with a slight increase in online casino gambling, there was no increase in likely problematic, high-intensity gambling and neither did total online gambling increase. Conclusions: This first, preliminary study revealed no increase in Swedish gambling activity, total or specifically online, in the first phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Future research should examine whether pandemic-induced transitioning between gambling modalities and/or increased participation in gambling, leads to long-term effects on prevalence of problem gambling.", "doi": "10.3389/fpubh.2020.554542", "pmid": "33117770", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7550730"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-01T15:10:25.688Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.163Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "252e6e3b499a4f00b054837e86a9f448", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/252e6e3b499a4f00b054837e86a9f448.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/252e6e3b499a4f00b054837e86a9f448"}}, "title": "Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in urine is rare and not associated with acute kidney injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients.", "authors": [{"family": "Frithiof", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bergqvist", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rhult", "given": "Josef D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Lipcsey", "given": "Miklos", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hultstr\u00f6m", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-29", "journal": {"title": "Crit Care", "issn": "1466-609X", "volume": "24", "issue": "1", "pages": "587", "issn-l": "1364-8535"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1186/s13054-020-03302-w", "pmid": "32993742", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Research Area: Biobanks for COVID-19 research": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:37:02.479Z", "modified": "2020-11-17T14:35:18.537Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5ed913f6997047d098f6186a54cff8bb", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5ed913f6997047d098f6186a54cff8bb.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5ed913f6997047d098f6186a54cff8bb"}}, "title": "MAIT cell activation and dynamics associated with COVID-19 disease severity.", "authors": [{"family": "Parrot", "given": "Tiphaine", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Gorin", "given": "Jean-Baptiste", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Ponzetta", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Maleki", "given": "Kimia T", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Kammann", "given": "Tobias", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Emg\u00e5rd", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Perez-Potti", "given": "Andr\u00e9", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sekine", "given": "Takuya", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Rivera-Ballesteros", "given": "Olga", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Gredmark-Russ", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rooyackers", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Folkesson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Lars I", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "Norrby-Teglund", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ljunggren", "given": "Hans-Gustaf", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkstr\u00f6m", "given": "Niklas K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Buggert", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Klingstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Johan K", "initials": "JK"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-28", "journal": {"title": "Sci Immunol", "issn": "2470-9468", "issn-l": "2470-9468", "volume": "5", "issue": "51", "pages": null}, "abstract": "Severe COVID-19 is characterized by excessive inflammation of the lower airways.

Our data, including benchmarking using 597 clinical patient samples and a standardised diagnostic system, demonstrate that direct RT-PCR is viable option to extraction-based tests. Using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we confirm effectiveness of heat inactivation by plaque assay and evaluate various generic buffers as transport medium for direct RT-PCR.

In this study, we applied a rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody test and performed serology assessment of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. In PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n = 45), the total antibody detection rate is 92% in hospitalized patients and 79% in non-hospitalized patients. The total IgM and IgG detection is 63% in patients with <2 weeks from disease onset; 85% in non-hospitalized patients with >2 weeks disease duration; and 91% in hospitalized patients with >2 weeks disease duration. We also compared different blood sample types and suggest a higher sensitivity by serum/plasma over whole blood.

Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppress, community transmission, by using physical distancing without lockdowns. Here we contrast the consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls and the associated direct healthcare related costs.\n\nWe used an age-stratified health-care demand extended SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model for describing inter-municipality mobility. The model was calibrated against data from municipalities in the Stockholm healthcare region.\n\nOur scenario with moderate to strong physical distancing describes well the observed health demand and deaths in Sweden up to the end of May 2020. In this scenario, the intensive care unit (ICU) demand reaches the pre-pandemic maximum capacity just above 500 beds. In the counterfactual scenario, the ICU demand is estimated to reach \u223c20 times higher than the pre-pandemic ICU capacity. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to 1 September, ranging from 5000 to 41 000, excluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Additionally, our statistical analysis of all causes excess mortality indicates that the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be increased by 40% (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.57).\n\nThe results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths, health demands and lowering healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period beyond the study period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.", "doi": "10.1093/ije/dyaa121", "pmid": "32954400", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5909271"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7543571"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T09:31:56.254Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.428Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "865012848aa3469da99c9e119fb80623", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/865012848aa3469da99c9e119fb80623.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/865012848aa3469da99c9e119fb80623"}}, "title": "COVID Isolation Eating Scale (CIES): Analysis of the impact of confinement in eating disorders and obesity-A collaborative international study.", "authors": [{"family": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Aranda", "given": "Fernando", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Mungu\u00eda", "given": "Lucero", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Mestre-Bach", "given": "Gemma", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Steward", "given": "Trevor", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Etxandi", "given": "Mikel", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Baenas", "given": "Isabel", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Granero", "given": "Roser", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "S\u00e1nchez", "given": "Isabel", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ortega", "given": "Emilio", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Andreu", "given": "Alba", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Moize", "given": "Violeta L", "initials": "VL"}, {"family": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Real", "given": "Jose M", "initials": "JM"}, {"family": "Tinahones", "given": "Francisco J", "initials": "FJ"}, {"family": "Dieg\u00fcez", "given": "Carlos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Fr\u00fchbeck", "given": "Gema", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Le Grange", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Tchanturia", "given": "Kate", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Karwautz", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Zeiler", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Favaro", "given": "Angela", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Claes", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Luyckx", "given": "Koen", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Shekriladze", "given": "Ia", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Serrano-Troncoso", "given": "Eduardo", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Rangil", "given": "Teresa", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Meler", "given": "Maria Eulalia Loran", "initials": "MEL"}, {"family": "Soriano-Pacheco", "given": "Jose", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Carceller-Sindreu", "given": "Mar", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bujalance-Arguijo", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lozano", "given": "Meritxell", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Linares", "given": "Raquel", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Gudiol", "given": "Carlota", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Carratala", "given": "Jordi", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Sanchez-Gonzalez", "given": "Jessica", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Machado", "given": "Paulo Pp", "initials": "PP"}, {"family": "H\u00e5kansson", "given": "Anders", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "T\u00fary", "given": "Ferenc", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "P\u00e1szthy", "given": "Bea", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Stein", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Papezov\u00e1", "given": "Hana", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Bax", "given": "Brigita", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Borisenkov", "given": "Mikhail F", "initials": "MF"}, {"family": "Popov", "given": "Sergey V", "initials": "SV"}, {"family": "Kim", "given": "Youl-Ri", "initials": "YR"}, {"family": "Nakazato", "given": "Michiko", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Godart", "given": "Nathalie", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "van Voren", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ilnytska", "given": "Tetiana", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Jue", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Rowlands", "given": "Katie", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Treasure", "given": "Janet", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Jim\u00e9nez-Murcia", "given": "Susana", "initials": "S"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-20", "journal": {"title": "Eur Eat Disord Rev", "issn": "1099-0968", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a serious and complex impact on the mental health of patients with an eating disorder (ED) and of patients with obesity.

Regarding the effects of confinement, positive and negative impacts of the confinement depends of the eating disorder subtype. Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and with obesity endorsed a positive response to treatment during confinement, no significant changes were found in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients, whereas Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) patients endorsed an increase in eating symptomatology and in psychopathology. Furthermore, AN patients expressed the greatest dissatisfaction and accommodation difficulty with remote therapy when compared with the previously provided face-to-face therapy.

Interestingly, while the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are higher in males than in females, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this review, we explore sex-related differences that may be contributing factors to the observed male-biased mortality from COVID-19. Males are considered the weaker sex in aspects related to endurance and infection control. Studies show that viral RNA clearance is delayed in males with COVID-19. A recent study has indicated that the testis can harbor coronavirus, and consequently, males show delayed viral clearance. However, the role of testis involvement in COVID-19 severity and mortality needs further research. Males and females show a distinct difference in immune system responses with females eliciting stronger immune responses to pathogens. This difference in immune system responses may be a major contributing factor to viral load, disease severity, and mortality. In addition, differences in sex hormone milieus could also be a determinant of viral infections as estrogen has immunoenhancing effects while testosterone has immunosuppressive effects. The sex-specific severity of COVID-19 infections indicates that further research on understanding the sex differences is needed. Inclusion of both males and females in basic research and clinical trials is required to provide critical information on sex-related differences that may help to better understand disease outcome and therapy.", "doi": "10.1186/s13293-020-00330-7", "pmid": "32948238", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s13293-020-00330-7"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7498997"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T12:42:10.704Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:25:40.954Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6fb23dcb8a064f699cf2617168197bf2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6fb23dcb8a064f699cf2617168197bf2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6fb23dcb8a064f699cf2617168197bf2"}}, "title": "Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and risk of future sickness", "authors": [{"family": "Dillner", "given": "Joakim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Elfstr\u00f6m", "given": "Miriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Blomqvist", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Eklund", "given": "Carina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lagheden", "given": "Camilla", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Nordqvist-Kleppe", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Cecilia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Olofsson", "given": "Jennie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Andersso", "given": "Eni", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Jernbom Falk", "given": "August", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "given": "Sofia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hultin", "given": "Emilie", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Pin", "given": "Elisa", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "M\u00e5nberg", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hedhammar", "given": "My", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hober", "given": "Sophia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mattsson", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Arroyo M\u00fchr", "given": "Laila Sara", "initials": "LS"}, {"family": "Conneryd Lundgren", "given": "Kalle", "initials": "K"}], "type": null, "published": "2020-09-18", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "Background: The extent that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may protect against future virus-associated disease is unknown.

Most states have implemented similar NPIs at similar time points.

We utilise mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model.\r\n\r\nThe changes in mobility have a considerable overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The shift in mobility in all categories shows high correlations with the death rates 1 month later. Reduction of movement within the grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for most of the decrease in R0.\r\n\r\nOur model predicts 3-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium.

This web survey included athletes in top leagues of soccer, ice hockey and handball in Sweden (N = 327, 62% men). A total of 66% and 51% were worried about the future of their sport or about their own future in sports, respectively. Feeling worse psychologically during the pandemic was common (72% of women, 40% of men, p < 0.001); depression criteria were endorsed by 19% of women and three percent of men (p < 0.001); anxiety criteria by 20% of women and five percent of men (p < 0.001). Reporting increased gambling during the pandemic was associated with gambling problem severity. Moderate-risk or problem gambling was seen in 10% of men and none of the women (p < 0.001). Depression and anxiety were associated with feeling worse during the COVID-19 pandemic and with concern over one's own sports future.

Predisposing risk factors to severe COVID-19 are male sex, underlying cardiovascular disease, or cardiovascular risk factors including noncontrolled diabetes mellitus or arterial hypertension, obesity, and advanced age. The VAS-European Independent Foundation in Angiology/Vascular Medicine draws attention to patients with vascular disease (VD) and presents an integral strategy for the management of patients with VD or cardiovascular risk factors (VD-CVR) and COVID-19. VAS recommends (1) a COVID-19-oriented primary health care network for patients with VD-CVR for identification of patients with VD-CVR in the community and patients' education for disease symptoms, use of eHealth technology, adherence to the antithrombotic and vascular regulating treatments, and (2) close medical follow-up for efficacious control of VD progression and prompt application of physical and social distancing measures in case of new epidemic waves. For patients with VD-CVR who receive home treatment for COVID-19, VAS recommends assessment for (1) disease worsening risk and prioritized hospitalization of those at high risk and (2) VTE risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, betrixaban, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for those at high risk. For hospitalized patients with VD-CVR and COVID-19, VAS recommends (1) routine thromboprophylaxis with weight-adjusted intermediate doses of LMWH (unless contraindication); (2) LMWH as the drug of choice over unfractionated heparin or direct oral anticoagulants for the treatment of VTE or hypercoagulability; (3) careful evaluation of the risk for disease worsening and prompt application of targeted antiviral or convalescence treatments; (4) monitoring of D-dimer for optimization of the antithrombotic treatment; and (5) evaluation of the risk of VTE before hospital discharge using the IMPROVE-D-dimer score and prolonged post-discharge thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban, betrixaban, or LMWH.", "doi": "10.1055/s-0040-1715798", "pmid": "32920811", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:37:40.375Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:38:41.229Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0b5aef6454014621b5298e639210e0c9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0b5aef6454014621b5298e639210e0c9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0b5aef6454014621b5298e639210e0c9"}}, "title": "Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from airways in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to serum antibody responses", "authors": [{"family": "Glans", "given": "Hedvig", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gredmark-Russ", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Olausson", "given": "Mikaela", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Falck-Jones", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Varnaite", "given": "Renata", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Christ", "given": "Wanda", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Maleki", "given": "Kimia T", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Lind Karlberg", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Broddesson", "given": "Sandra", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Falck-Jones", "given": "Ryan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Bell", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Niclas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Farnert", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Smed Sorensen", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Klingstrom", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Brave", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}], "type": null, "published": "2020-09-13", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "issn-l": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

There are major concerns in Africa due to existing high prevalence rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases and limited resources in terms of personnel, beds and equipment. Alongside this, concerns that lockdown and other measures will have on prevention and management of other infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are an increasing issue with rising morbidity and mortality rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that a lack of nets and treatment could result in up to 18 million additional cases of malaria and up to 30,000 additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nDocument current prevalence and mortality rates from COVID-19 alongside economic and other measures to reduce its spread and impact across Africa. In addition, suggested ways forward among all key stakeholder groups.\n\nContextualise the findings from a wide range of publications including internet-based publications coupled with input from senior-level personnel.\n\nPrevalence and mortality rates are currently lower in Africa than among several Western countries and the USA. This could be due to a number of factors including early instigation of lockdown and border closures, the younger age of the population, lack of robust reporting systems and as yet unidentified genetic and other factors. Innovation is accelerating to address concerns with available equipment. There are ongoing steps to address the level of misinformation and its consequences including fines. There are also ongoing initiatives across Africa to start addressing the unintended consequences of COVID-19 activities including lockdown measures and their impact on NCDs including the likely rise in mental health disorders, exacerbated by increasing stigma associated with COVID-19. Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination. However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality.\n\nThere are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries. Research is ongoing to clarify the unintended consequences given ongoing concerns to guide future activities.

During the second quadratic growth phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation much earlier than the others.

Many people have suffered from symptoms like COVID-19 during this pandemic, and some people have cured without taking any treatment or taking minor pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. However, they might be spreading their infections among their family members and perhaps in the community. It is unsure that individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms are positive with COVID-19, but our concern is, during this pandemic, any types of symptoms such as flu-like symptoms should have been taken seriously. This study was observed in the cases from three families with COVID-19 like symptoms. Case presentation This observational study was done between May 20 and Jun 2, 2020, in Bangladesh. The members of the inspected families shared COVID-19 like symptoms that were lasted for 3-10 days.

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage. Our results, if confirmed by additional experimental data, may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, guide the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the

beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases has faced major challenges. Recommendations for \"social distancing\" and the fear of patients becoming infected during a visit to a medical facility have led to a drastic decrease in personal doctor-patient contacts. This affects both acute care and treatment of the chronically ill. The immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is so far only insufficiently understood and could be altered in a favorable or unfavorable way by therapy with monoclonal antibodies. There is currently no evidence for an increased risk of a severe COVID-19 course in allergic patients. Many patients are under ongoing therapy with biologicals that inhibit type 2 immune responses via various mechanisms. There is uncertainty about possible immunological interactions and potential risks of these biologicals in the case of an infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA selective literature search was carried out in PubMed, Livivo, and the internet to cover the past 10 years (May 2010 - April 2020). Additionally, the current German-language publications were analyzed. Based on these data, the present position paper provides recommendations for the biological treatment of patients with allergic and atopy-associated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn order to maintain in-office consultation services, a safe treatment environment must be created that is adapted to the pandemic situation. To date, there is a lack of reliable study data on the care for patients with complex respiratory, atopic, and allergic diseases in times of an imminent infection risk from SARS-CoV-2. Type-2-dominant immune reactions, as they are frequently seen in allergic patients, could influence various phases of COVID-19, e.g., by slowing down the immune reactions. Theoretically, this could have an unfavorable effect in the early phase of a SARS-Cov-2 infection, but also a positive effect during a cytokine storm in the later phase of severe courses. However, since there is currently no evidence for this, all data from patients treated with a biological directed against type 2 immune reactions who develop COVID-19 should be collected in registries, and their disease courses documented in order to be able to provide experience-based instructions in the future.\n\nThe use of biologicals for the treatment of bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and spontaneous urticaria should be continued as usual in patients without suspected infection or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. If available, it is recommended to prefer a formulation for self-application and to offer telemedical monitoring. Treatment should aim at the best possible control of difficult-to-control allergic and atopic diseases using adequate rescue and add-on therapy and should avoid the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids. If SARS-CoV-2 infection is proven or reasonably suspected, the therapy should be determined by weighing the benefits and risks individually for the patient in question, and the patient should be involved in the decision-making. It should be kept in mind that the potential effects of biologicals on the immune response in COVID-19 are currently not known. Telemedical offers are particularly desirable for the acute consultation needs of suitable patients.", "doi": "10.5414/ALX02166E", "pmid": "32915172", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7480069"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:49:30.607Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:49:30.629Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ea3e7e32fe0a47af92fac82feeace707", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea3e7e32fe0a47af92fac82feeace707.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ea3e7e32fe0a47af92fac82feeace707"}}, "title": "The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Consiglio", "given": "Camila Rosat", "initials": "CR"}, {"family": "Cotugno", "given": "Nicola", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sardh", "given": "Fabian", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Pou", "given": "Christian", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Amodio", "given": "Donato", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Rodriguez", "given": "Lucie", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Tan", "given": "Ziyang", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Zicari", "given": "Sonia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ruggiero", "given": "Alessandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Pascucci", "given": "Giuseppe Rubens", "initials": "GR"}, {"family": "Santilli", "given": "Veronica", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Campbell", "given": "Tessa", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Bryceson", "given": "Yenan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Wang", "given": "Jun", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Marchesi", "given": "Alessandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lakshmikanth", "given": "Tadepally", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Campana", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Villani", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rossi", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "CACTUS Study Team", "given": "", "initials": ""}, {"family": "Landegren", "given": "Nils", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Palma", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Brodin", "given": "Petter", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-06", "journal": {"title": "Cell", "issn": "1097-4172", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null, "issn-l": "0092-8674"}, "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children.

The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines, and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2, and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with respect to T cell subsets, interleukin (IL)-17A, and biomarkers associated with arterial damage.

These processes are accompanied by water evaporation resulting in reduction of the droplet size.

Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the 'up' and 'down' conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5", "pmid": "32887876", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder:

In the early stage, we have issued \"A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)\"; now there are many direct evidences emerged and may change some of previous recommendations and it is ripe for develop an evidence-based guideline. We formed a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group members proposed 29 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 covering the following areas: chemoprophylaxis, diagnosis, treatments, and discharge management. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the management of COVID-19, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 34 statements. Among them, 6 were strong recommendations for, 14 were weak recommendations for, 3 were weak recommendations against and 11 were ungraded consensus-based statement. They covered topics of chemoprophylaxis (including agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) agents), diagnosis (including clinical manifestations, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respiratory tract specimens, IgM and IgG antibody tests, chest computed tomography, chest x-ray, and CT features of asymptomatic infections), treatments (including lopinavir-ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, interferon, remdesivir, combination of antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, interleukin-6 inhibitors, interleukin-1 inhibitors, glucocorticoid, qingfei paidu decoction, lianhua qingwen granules/capsules, convalescent plasma, lung transplantation, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and discharge management (including discharge criteria and management plan in patients whose RT-PCR retesting shows SARS-CoV-2 positive after discharge).

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Robust analysis of outcomes for CLL patients, particularly examining effects of baseline characteristics and CLL-directed therapy, is critical to optimally manage CLL patients through this evolving pandemic. CLL patients diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 across 43 international centers (n = 198) were included. Hospital admission occurred in 90%. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 70.5 years. Median Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score was 8 (range, 4-32). Thirty-nine percent were treatment naive (\"watch and wait\"), while 61% had received \u22651 CLL-directed therapy (median, 2; range, 1-8). Ninety patients (45%) were receiving active CLL therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis, most commonly Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's; n = 68/90 [76%]). At a median follow-up of 16 days, the overall case fatality rate was 33%, though 25% remain admitted. Watch-and-wait and treated cohorts had similar rates of admission (89% vs 90%), intensive care unit admission (35% vs 36%), intubation (33% vs 25%), and mortality (37% vs 32%). CLL-directed treatment with BTKi's at COVID-19 diagnosis did not impact survival (case fatality rate, 34% vs 35%), though the BTKi was held during the COVID-19 course for most patients. These data suggest that the subgroup of CLL patients admitted with COVID-19, regardless of disease phase or treatment status, are at high risk of death.

We performed a retrospective analysis to compare and evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment on disease progression. For this purpose, the clinical records and laboratory indicators were extracted from electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with LMWH, and 21 without LMWH) hospitalized (Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology) from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.011). Likewise, changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products in the LMWH group before and after treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.035). Remarkably, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (P = 0.006), indicating that, besides other beneficial properties, LMWH may exert an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate in part the \"cytokine storm\" induced by the virus.

It is possible to avoid the banality of evil, intended as lack of thinking on what we do when we do, by using the emergence of the emergency of COVID-19 as a Trojan horse to achieve some of the sustainable development goals such as universal health coverage and equity in access, thus acting on environmental factors is the key for global health improvement.", "doi": "10.1007/s42399-020-00486-8", "pmid": "32905109", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "486"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7462656"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:54:02.093Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:54:02.118Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7ae6940fde8344e3bbf1e8e26cebc2d6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7ae6940fde8344e3bbf1e8e26cebc2d6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7ae6940fde8344e3bbf1e8e26cebc2d6"}}, "title": "COVID-19: how things change in a short while.", "authors": [{"family": "Stolfo", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Sinagra", "given": "Gianfranco", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"title": "Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Pharmacother", "issn": "2055-6845", "volume": "6", "issue": "5", "pages": "280-281", "issn-l": "2055-6837"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa092", "pmid": "32678899", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5873153"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7454535"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:34:29.256Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:34:29.265Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7325494cd545495586695b3c740af140", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7325494cd545495586695b3c740af140.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7325494cd545495586695b3c740af140"}}, "title": "Outcomes of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "authors": [{"family": "Greco", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Buccheri", "given": "Sergio", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "D'Arrigo", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Calderone", "given": "Dario", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Agnello", "given": "Federica", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Monte", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Milluzzo", "given": "Rocco Paolo", "initials": "RP"}, {"family": "Franchina", "given": "Antonio Gabriele", "initials": "AG"}, {"family": "Ingala", "given": "Salvatore", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Capodanno", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"title": "Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Pharmacother", "issn": "2055-6845", "volume": "6", "issue": "5", "pages": "335-337", "issn-l": "2055-6837"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa074", "pmid": "32671399", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5872101"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7454531"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:22:06.498Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:45:14.800Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "70b2e65b6cd84e38a2b89ed18da66416", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/70b2e65b6cd84e38a2b89ed18da66416.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/70b2e65b6cd84e38a2b89ed18da66416"}}, "title": "Association between eating behavior and quarantine/confinement stressors during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak.", "authors": [{"family": "Haddad", "given": "Chadia", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zakhour", "given": "Maha", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Bou Kheir", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Haddad", "given": "Rima", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Al Hachach", "given": "Myriam", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sacre", "given": "Hala", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Salameh", "given": "Pascale", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-01", "journal": {"title": "J Eat Disord", "issn": "2050-2974", "volume": "8", "issue": null, "pages": "40", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Quarantine/confinement is an effective measure to face the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here, we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin, an OXT agonist, and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin's transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine, both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1152/physiolgenomics.00095.2020", "pmid": "32809918", "labels": {"Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T12:49:51.761Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T13:20:47.921Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "ff7fb22175a8472799663bb90467ac15", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ff7fb22175a8472799663bb90467ac15.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/ff7fb22175a8472799663bb90467ac15"}}, "title": "Prioritizing Cleft/Craniofacial Surgical Care after the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Breugem", "given": "Corstiaan", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Smit", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Mark", "given": "Hans", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Davies", "given": "Gareth", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Schachner", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Collard", "given": "Mechelle", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sell", "given": "Debbie", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Autelitano", "given": "Luca", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Rezzonico", "given": "Angela", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mazzoleni", "given": "Fabio", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Novelli", "given": "Giorgio", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Mossey", "given": "Peter", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Persson", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mehendale", "given": "Felicity", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Gaggl", "given": "Alexander", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "van Gogh", "given": "Christine", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Zuurbier", "given": "Petra", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Reinart", "given": "Siegmar", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "de Graaff", "given": "Feike", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Meazzini", "given": "Costanza", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open", "issn": "2169-7574", "volume": "8", "issue": "9", "pages": "e3080", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "It is anticipated that in due course the burden of emergency care due to COVID-19 infected patients will reduce sufficiently to permit elective surgical procedures to recommence.

Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia.\n\nUtilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n = 1078 with 628 males; mean age = 26.24 years [SD \u00b1 7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding.\n\nProblematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly.

This study aimed to test whether levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in combination with D-dimer were predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The clinical characteristics of 305 COVID-19 patients were analysed and were compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Of the 305 patients, 85 (27.9%) died and 220 (72.1%) were discharged from hospital. Compared with discharged cases, non-survivor cases were older and their BUN and D-dimer levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable Cox regression analyses identified BUN and D-dimer levels as independent risk factors for poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that elevated levels of BUN and D-dimer were associated with increased mortality (log-rank, P < 0.0001). The area under the curve for BUN combined with D-dimer was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.97), with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 91%. Based on BUN and D-dimer levels on admission, a nomogram model was developed that showed good discrimination, with a concordance index of 0.94. Together, initial BUN and D-dimer levels were associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. The combination of BUN \u2265 4.6 mmol/L and D-dimer \u2265 0.845 \u03bcg/mL appears to identify patients at high risk of in-hospital mortality, therefore it may prove to be a powerful risk assessment tool for severe COVID-19 patients.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106110", "pmid": "32712332", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0924-8579(20)30293-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7377803"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:15:03.755Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:18:57.786Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "da6866a15f904121ace0557c7923f7b9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/da6866a15f904121ace0557c7923f7b9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/da6866a15f904121ace0557c7923f7b9"}}, "title": "Developing thinking around mental health science: the example of intrusive, emotional mental imagery after psychological trauma.", "authors": [{"family": "Singh", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Espinosa", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Ji", "given": "Julie L", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "Moulds", "given": "Michelle L", "initials": "ML"}, {"family": "Holmes", "given": "Emily A", "initials": "EA"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Cogn Neuropsychiatry", "issn": "1464-0619", "volume": "25", "issue": "5", "pages": "348-363", "issn-l": "1354-6805"}, "abstract": "One route to advancing psychological treatments is to harness mental health science, a multidisciplinary approach including individuals with lived experience and end users (e.g., Holmes, E.

First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be modified in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nThese three approaches suggest options for potential innovative avenues through which mental health science may be harnessed to recouple basic and applied research and transform treatment development.", "doi": "10.1080/13546805.2020.1804845", "pmid": "32847486", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:55:45.251Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:36:36.440Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "cd3b5e14785c493a88046a386f265e86", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd3b5e14785c493a88046a386f265e86.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/cd3b5e14785c493a88046a386f265e86"}}, "title": "COVID-19: guidance on palliative care from a European Respiratory Society international task force.", "authors": [{"family": "Janssen", "given": "Daisy J A", "initials": "DJA"}, {"family": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Currow", "given": "David C", "initials": "DC"}, {"family": "Johnson", "given": "Miriam J", "initials": "MJ"}, {"family": "Maddocks", "given": "Matthew", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Simonds", "given": "Anita K", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Tonia", "given": "Thomy", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Marsaa", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Eur Respir J", "issn": "1399-3003", "volume": "56", "issue": "3", "issn-l": "0903-1936"}, "abstract": "Many people are dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but consensus guidance on palliative care in COVID-19 is lacking.

Therefore, we aimed to make consensus recommendations for palliative care for patients with COVID-19 using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process.\n\nWe invited 90 international experts to complete an online survey including stating their agreement, or not, with 14 potential recommendations. At least 70% agreement on directionality was needed to provide consensus recommendations.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is necessary to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, but-owing to its essential metabolic roles-it may be difficult to target it in therapies. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which interacts with ACE2, may be a better candidate for targeted therapies. Using publicly available expression data, we show that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in many host tissues, including lung. The highest expression of ACE2 is found in the testes, whereas the prostate displays the highest expression of TMPRSS2. Given the increased severity of disease among older men with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we address the potential roles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their contribution to the sex differences in severity of disease. We show that expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are overall comparable between men and women in multiple tissues, suggesting that differences in the expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the lung and other non-sex-specific tissues may not explain the gender disparities in severity of SARS CoV-2. However, given their instrumental roles for SARS-CoV-2 infection and their pleiotropic expression, targeting the activity and expression levels of TMPRSS2 is a rational approach to treat COVID-19.",

Given that severe strokes are typically associated with poor prognosis and can be very efficiently treated with recanalization techniques, confirmation of this putative association is urgently warranted in a large representative patient cohort to alert stroke clinicians, and inform pre- and in-hospital acute stroke patient pathways. We pooled all consecutive patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke in 28 sites from 16 countries. To assess whether stroke severity and outcomes (assessed at discharge or at the latest assessment for those patients still hospitalized) in patients with acute ischemic stroke are different between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching analyses of our COVID-19 patients with non-COVID-19 patients registered in the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne Registry between 2003 and 2019. Between January 27, 2020, and May 19, 2020, 174 patients (median age 71.2 years; 37.9% females) with COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke were hospitalized (median of 12 patients per site). The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 4-18). In the 1:1 matched sample of 336 patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was higher in patients with COVID-19 (10 [IQR, 4-18] versus 6 [IQR, 3-14]), P=0.03; (odds ratio, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.08-2.65] for higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score). There were 48 (27.6%) deaths, of which 22 were attributed to COVID-19 and 26 to stroke. Among 96 survivors with available information about disability status, 49 (51%) had severe disability at discharge. In the propensity score-matched population (n=330), patients with COVID-19 had higher risk for severe disability (median mRS 4 [IQR, 2-6] versus 2 [IQR, 1-4], P<0.001) and death (odds ratio, 4.3 [95% CI, 2.22-8.30]) compared with patients without COVID-19.

Should patients develop coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring hospital admission for treatment of hypoxia, the risk for thromboembolic complications increases greatly. These thromboembolic events are the result of at least two distinct mechanisms - microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary system (immunothrombosis) and hospital-associated venous thromboembolism. Since pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, there is concern regarding the potentially increased risk of thrombotic complications among pregnant women with COVID-19. To date, however, pregnant women do not appear to have a substantially increased risk of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19. Nevertheless, several organizations have vigilantly issued pregnancy-specific guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19. Discrepancies between these guidelines reflect the altruistic wish to protect patients and lack of high-quality evidence available to inform clinical practice. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the drug of choice for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, its utility in non-pregnant patients is only established against venous thromboembolism, as LMWH may have little or no effect on immunothrombosis. Decisions about initiation and duration of prophylactic anticoagulation in the context of pregnancy and COVID-19 must take into consideration disease severity, outpatient vs inpatient status, temporal relation between disease occurrence and timing of childbirth, and the underlying prothrombotic risk conferred by additional comorbidities. There is currently no evidence to recommend the use of intermediate or therapeutic doses of LMWH in thromboprophylaxis, which may increase bleeding risk without reducing thrombotic risk in pregnant patients with COVID-19. Likewise, there is no evidence to comment on the role of low-dose aspirin in thromboprophylaxis or of anti-cytokine and antiviral agents in preventing immunothrombosis. These unanswered questions are being studied within the context of clinical trials.", "doi": "10.1111/aogs.13962", "pmid": "32678949", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7404828"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:14:06.219Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:45:13.568Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "88f2b1b690ab477d9fe2589437f08ec1", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/88f2b1b690ab477d9fe2589437f08ec1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/88f2b1b690ab477d9fe2589437f08ec1"}}, "title": "Towards pandemic preparedness beyond COVID-19", "authors": [{"family": "Naguib", "given": "Mahmoud M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Ellstr\u00f6m", "given": "Patrik", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "J\u00e4rhult", "given": "Josef D", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Lundkvist", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Olsen", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "The Lancet Microbe", "issn": "2666-5247", "volume": "1", "issue": "5", "pages": "e185-e186", "issn-l": "2666-5247"}, "abstract": "Review", "doi": "10.1016/s2666-5247(20)30088-4", "pmid": "32838347", "labels": {"Type: Other": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T07:08:50.155Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T10:31:18.635Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7df03080a93f4616927e9fdeb1a5576c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7df03080a93f4616927e9fdeb1a5576c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7df03080a93f4616927e9fdeb1a5576c"}}, "title": "Does prolonged propofol sedation of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients contribute to critical illness myopathy?", "authors": [{"family": "L\u00f6nnqvist", "given": "Per-Arne", "initials": "PA"}, {"family": "Bell", "given": "Max", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Karlsson", "given": "Torbj\u00f6rn", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wiklund", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "H\u00f6glund", "given": "Anna-Stina", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Br J Anaesth", "issn": "1471-6771", "volume": "125", "issue": "3", "pages": "e334-e336", "issn-l": "0007-0912"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bja.2020.05.056", "pmid": "32600801", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0007-0912(20)30440-2"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7284264"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T08:45:29.899Z", "modified": "2020-11-22T08:45:29.918Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "679be0bb5b0c492f8c69165fadf5dfb2", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/679be0bb5b0c492f8c69165fadf5dfb2.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/679be0bb5b0c492f8c69165fadf5dfb2"}}, "title": "Predicted COVID-19 fatality rates based on age, sex, comorbidities and health system capacity.", "authors": [{"family": "Ghisolfi", "given": "Selene", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Alm\u00e5s", "given": "Ingvild", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Sandefur", "given": "Justin C", "initials": "JC"}, {"family": "von Carnap", "given": "Tillman", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Heitner", "given": "Jesse", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bold", "given": "Tessa", "initials": "T"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "BMJ Glob Health", "issn": "2059-7908", "volume": "5", "issue": "9", "issn-l": "2059-7908"}, "abstract": "Early reports suggest the fatality rate from COVID-19 varies greatly across countries, but non-random testing and incomplete vital registration systems render it impossible to directly estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR) in many low- and middle-income countries.

Accounting for differences in the distribution of age, sex and relevant comorbidities yields substantial differences in the predicted IFR across 21 world regions, ranging from 0.11% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.07% for high-income Asia Pacific.

To adjust for health system capacity, we incorporate regional differences in the relative odds of infection fatality from childhood respiratory syncytial virus. This adjustment greatly diminishes but does not entirely erase the demography-based advantage predicted in the lowest income settings, with regional estimates of the predicted COVID-19 IFR ranging from 0.37% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.45% for Eastern Europe.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003094", "pmid": "32912856", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "bmjgh-2020-003094"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7482102"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T12:43:18.757Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T12:43:18.768Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "5a93a8b03dbb42fba1d041a2c4b25fcc", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5a93a8b03dbb42fba1d041a2c4b25fcc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/5a93a8b03dbb42fba1d041a2c4b25fcc"}}, "title": "Management of the emergency response to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden, and winter preparations.", "authors": [{"family": "Ohrling", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "\u00d8vretveit", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lockowandt", "given": "Ulf", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Brommels", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sparring", "given": "Vibeke", "initials": "V"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "J Prim Health Care", "issn": "1172-6156", "volume": "12", "issue": "3", "pages": "207-214", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sweden is unique in adopting a 'no-lockdown' public health approach to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak. There were fears that health services would not be able to care for high numbers of COVID-19 patients. AIM To describe and review the emergency response of a public primary and community health-care organisation in Stockholm, Sweden, to the demand for care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during March-July 2020, and summarise preparations for the months to follow. METHODS This was a rapid implementation action research case study, which also draws on one author's experience as Chief Executive Officer and other members' experience in an emergency management group. RESULTS Sweden experienced similar mortality per million population to the UK, despite the different public health strategy used to address the COVID-19 outbreak. The Stockholm-integrated public primary and community health-care service, serving a population of 2.3 million, made many changes quickly. One change included coordinating non-acute private health-care services, following the local government emergency directive to do so. DISCUSSION It is possible that the fast and effective response by management and services in primary and community health care reduced infection and hospital demand, which contributed to a lower mortality than otherwise expected. The actions and preparations described for Stockholm's response may provide ideas for other health-care systems. The partnership research approach between the Karolinska Medical University and the Region Stockholm health-care system used in this project shows that rapid research methods have advantages for both partners in an emergency situation.", "doi": "10.1071/HC20082", "pmid": "32988442", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "HC20082"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-27T12:40:02.016Z", "modified": "2020-11-27T12:40:02.043Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "536b4d0da2254331a79a3bf4d5693abc", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/536b4d0da2254331a79a3bf4d5693abc.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/536b4d0da2254331a79a3bf4d5693abc"}}, "title": "Per capita death and infection rates should be avoided in international comparisons.", "authors": [{"family": "Silva", "given": "W T A F", "initials": "WTAF"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Public Health", "issn": "1476-5616", "volume": "186", "issue": null, "pages": "18-19", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.038", "pmid": "32750504", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "S0033-3506(20)30276-6"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7395585"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T15:48:12.388Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T15:48:12.410Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "2e1cf5a5227047e5988485212dca347c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2e1cf5a5227047e5988485212dca347c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/2e1cf5a5227047e5988485212dca347c"}}, "title": "The Rheumatologist's Role in the Battle Against COVID-19: Insights from the Front Line and Challenges for the Future.", "authors": [{"family": "Koutsianas", "given": "Christos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Chatzidionysiou", "given": "Katerina", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-00", "journal": {"title": "Mediterr J Rheumatol", "issn": "2529-198X", "volume": "31", "issue": "Suppl 2", "pages": "247-252", "issn-l": "2529-198X"}, "abstract": "As the worldwide burden of COVID-19 increases exponentially, healthcare systems are plagued by unprecedented pressure.

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed.\n\nThis is the first edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review is based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines, and our 8-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and nonserious adverse events. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until August 7, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 33 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 13,312 participants. All trials were at overall high risk of bias. We identified one trial randomizing 6,425 participants to dexamethasone versus standard care. This trial showed evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.93; p < 0.001; low certainty) and on mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.62-0.95; p = 0.021; low certainty). It was possible to perform meta-analysis of 10 comparisons. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between remdesivir versus placebo on all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37; p = 0.34, I2 = 58%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80-1.11; p = 0.48, I2 = 29%; 2 trials; low certainty). Meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of remdesivir versus placebo on serious adverse events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.009, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) mainly driven by respiratory failure in one trial. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses showed that we could exclude the possibility that hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.97-1.19; p = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) and serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96-1.18; p = 0.21; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) by 20% or more, and meta-analysis showed evidence of a harmful effect on nonserious adverse events (RR 2.40; 95% CI 2.01-2.87; p < 0.00001; I2 = 90%; 6 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care on serious adverse events (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39-1.04; p = 0.07, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.85-1.53; p = 0.38, I2 = 75%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between convalescent plasma versus standard care on all-cause mortality (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.33-1.10; p = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Five single trials showed statistically significant results but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. None of the remaining trials showed evidence of a difference on our predefined outcomes. Because of the lack of relevant data, it was not possible to perform other meta-analyses, network meta-analysis, or individual patient data meta-analyses. The main limitation of this living review is the paucity of data currently available. Furthermore, the included trials were all at risks of systematic errors and random errors.\n\nOur results show that dexamethasone and remdesivir might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients, but the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, so more trials are needed. We can exclude the possibility of hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reducing the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20% or more. Otherwise, no evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists.

Median sampling time for initial SARS-CoV-2 in serum was 1 (IQR 1-2) day after admission corresponding to day 10 (IQR 8-12) after symptom onset. Median ages were 53 (IQR 44-67) and 63 (IQR 52-74) years for the PCR-negative and positive patients, respectively. In the serum PCR negative and positive groups 3/106 and 15/61 patients died, respectively.The hazard ratios for critical disease and all-cause mortality were 7.2 (95% CI 3.0-17) and 8.6 (95% CI 2.4-30), respectively for patients that were serum PCR positive compared to serum PCR negative.Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at hospital admission indicates a high-risk of progression to critical disease and death.", "doi": "10.1093/cid/ciaa1285", "pmid": "32856036", "labels": {"Funder: VR: Special COVID-19 funding": null, "Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null, "Funder: VR": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5898271"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7499508"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-04T08:59:08.585Z", "modified": "2020-12-04T08:59:08.604Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "1edfbec48fb445bd9b215700435d8ded", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1edfbec48fb445bd9b215700435d8ded.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/1edfbec48fb445bd9b215700435d8ded"}}, "title": "A case-report of widespread pulmonary embolism in a middle-aged male seven weeks after asymptomatic suspected COVID 19 infection.", "authors": [{"family": "Beckman", "given": "Mats", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Nyr\u00e9n", "given": "Sven", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Kistner", "given": "Anna", "initials": "A"}], "type": "case reports", "published": "2020-08-28", "journal": {"title": "Thromb J", "issn": "1477-9560", "volume": "18", "issue": null, "pages": "19", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is seen in high frequency in hospital-treated patients with Covid-19.

Protocols were screened by two investigators independently against pre-defined eligibility criteria. Quality of the included protocols was assessed according to the modified 14-item SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 Statement.\n\nWe included 82 randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocols investigating treatment modalities for COVID-19. These ongoing trials are being conducted in 16 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China, and study interventions were either Western medicines (n = 56) or traditional Chinese medicine (n = 26). Findings of our quality assessment indicated that the existing trial protocols could be further improved on several aspects, including selection and definition of outcome measures, descriptions of study interventions and comparators, study subject recruitment time, definition of study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and allocation concealment methods. Descriptions of random sequence generation methodologies were accurate for the majority of included trial protocols (n = 64; 78.05%); however, reporting of allocation concealment remained unclear in 63 (76.83%) protocols. Therefore, the overall risk of selection bias across these RCTs was judged to be unclear. A total of 52 (63.41%) included RCT protocols were open-label trials and are thus associated with a high risk of performance bias and detection bias.\n\nQuality of currently available RCT protocols on the treatments for COVID-19 could be further improved. For transparency and effective knowledge translation in real-world clinically settings, it is important for trial investigators to standardize baseline treatments for patients with COVID-19 and assess clinically important core outcome measures.

The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25% (95% CI: 24 to 26%) in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points (95% CI: 3 to 5 percentage points [p.p.]) in Denmark. This suggests that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggests that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low-health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2010068117", "pmid": "32747573", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "2010068117"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7456178"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:00:21.918Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:00:21.930Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9bdc4f367ba845b2be31cf156b1c4ebd", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9bdc4f367ba845b2be31cf156b1c4ebd.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9bdc4f367ba845b2be31cf156b1c4ebd"}}, "title": "An Ethics Framework for Making Resource Allocation Decisions Within Clinical Care: Responding to COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Dawson", "given": "Angus", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Isaacs", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Jansen", "given": "Melanie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Jordens", "given": "Christopher", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Kerridge", "given": "Ian", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Kihlbom", "given": "Ulrik", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Kilham", "given": "Henry", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Preisz", "given": "Anne", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Sheahan", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Skowronski", "given": "George", "initials": "G"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-25", "journal": {"title": "J Bioeth Inq", "issn": "1176-7529", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "On March, 24, 2020, 818 cases of COVID-19 had been reported in New South Wales, Australia, and new cases were increasing at an exponential rate.

The unpredictability of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) poses a major burden on health care and economic systems across the world. This is caused by the paucity of in-depth knowledge of the risk factors for severe COVID-19, insufficient diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the absence of specific and effective drug treatments.

Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health-care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.", "doi": "10.1101/2020.08.19.20178178", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:40:52.446Z", "modified": "2020-12-04T08:57:26.968Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81"}}, "title": "Natural killer cell immunotypes related to COVID-19 disease severity.", "authors": [{"family": "Maucourant", "given": "Christopher", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Filipovic", "given": "Iva", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ponzetta", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Cornillet", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hertwig", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Strunz", "given": "Benedikt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lentini", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Reinius", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Brownlie", "given": "Demi", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Cuapio", "given": "Angelica", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ask", "given": "Eivind Heggernes", "initials": "EH"}, {"family": "Hull", "given": "Ryan M", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "Haroun-Izquierdo", "given": "Alvaro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schaffer", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Klingstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Folkesson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Buggert", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Johan K", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Lars I", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "Rooyackers", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Ljunggren", "given": "Hans-Gustaf", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Malmberg", "given": "Karl-Johan", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Micha\u00eblsson", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Marquardt", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hammer", "given": "Quirin", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkstr\u00f6m", "given": "Niklas K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-21", "journal": {"title": "Sci Immunol", "issn": "2470-9468", "issn-l": "2470-9468", "volume": "5", "issue": "50", "pages": null}, "abstract": "Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important to decipher mechanisms of host responses and interpret disease pathogenesis.

Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18-44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America.\n\nThis observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects.\n\nPregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes.\n\nAlthough pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms.

Although displaying a wide variety of shapes and sizes, they are all composed of nucleic acid encapsulated into a protein capsid. After virions enter the host cell, they replicate to produce multiple copies of themselves. They then lyse the host, releasing virions to infect new cells. The high proliferation rate of viruses is the underlying cause of their fast transmission among living species. Although many viruses are harmless, some of them are responsible for severe diseases such as AIDS, viral hepatitis, and flu. Traditionally, electron microscopy is used to identify and characterize viruses. This approach is time- and labor-consuming, which is problematic upon pandemic proliferation of previously unknown viruses, such as H1N1 and COVID-19. Herein, we demonstrate a novel diagnosis approach for label-free identification and structural characterization of individual viruses that is based on a combination of nanoscale Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Using atomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy, we were able to probe structural organization of the virions of Herpes Simplex Type 1 viruses and bacteriophage MS2. We also showed that tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) could be used to reveal protein secondary structure and amino acid composition of the virus surface.

Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1\u03b2, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1\u03b2 than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1\u03b2 blockade in treatment of COVID-19.

Many governments have begun to implement exit strategies that relax restrictions while attempting to control the risk of a surge in cases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding interventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the face of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from the Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May 2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if answered, would allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. This roadmap requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and policymakers, and has three parts: (i) improve estimation of key epidemiological parameters; (ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in populations; and (iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries. This will provide important information for planning exit strategies that balance socio-economic benefits with public health.", "doi": "10.1098/rspb.2020.1405", "pmid": "32781946", "labels": {"Type: Review": null, "Funder: VR: Special COVID-19 funding": null, "Funder: VR": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7575516"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T08:41:04.303Z", "modified": "2020-12-04T09:11:38.432Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f232eaf8e0594f659f7ff3d2ea8bf32a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f232eaf8e0594f659f7ff3d2ea8bf32a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f232eaf8e0594f659f7ff3d2ea8bf32a"}}, "title": "Pronounced difference in Covid-19 antibody prevalence indicates cluster transmission in Stockholm, Sweden.", "authors": [{"family": "Lundkvist", "given": "\u00c5ke", "initials": "\u00c5"}, {"family": "Hanson", "given": "Stefan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Olsen", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-11", "journal": {"title": "Infect Ecol Epidemiol", "issn": "2000-8686", "volume": "10", "issue": "1", "pages": "1806505", "issn-l": "2000-8686"}, "abstract": "The prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies on June 17-18, 2020 was investigated in two residential areas of Stockholm, Sweden.

Initial data suggest that overall, pregnancy is not a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, case series have suggested that maternal obesity is one of the most important comorbidities associated with more severe disease. In obese individuals, suppressors of cytokine signaling are upregulated and type I and III interferon responses are delayed and blunted leading to ineffective viral clearance. Obesity is also associated with changes in systemic immunity involving a wide range of immune cells and mechanisms that lead to low-grade chronic inflammation, which can compromise antiviral immunity. Macrophage activation in adipose tissue can produce low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6). Further, adipocyte secretion of leptin is pro-inflammatory and high circulating levels of leptin have been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The synergistic effects of obesity-associated delays in immune control of COVID-19 with mechanical stress of increased adipose tissue may contribute to a greater risk of pulmonary compromise in obese pregnant women. In this review, we bring together data regarding obesity as a key co-morbidity for COVID-19 in pregnancy with known changes in the antiviral immune response associated with obesity.

Symptoms of severe burnout, anxiety and depression were collected. Factors independently associated with severe burnout were assessed using Cox model.\n\nResponse rate was 20% (1001 completed questionnaires were returned, 45 years [39-53], 34% women, from 85 countries, 12 regions, 50% university-affiliated hospitals). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression or severe burnout was 46.5%, 30.2%, and 51%, respectively, and varied significantly across regions. Rating of the relationship between intensivists and other ICU stakeholders differed significantly according to the presence of anxiety, depression, or burnout. Similar figures were reported for their rating of the ethical climate or the quality of the decision-making. Factors independently associated with anxiety were female gender (HR 1.85 [1.33-2.55]), working in a university-affiliated hospital (HR 0.58 [0.42-0.80]), living in a city of > 1 million inhabitants (HR 1.40 [1.01-1.94]), and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.83 [0.77-0.90]).

Although nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs are the most commonly used biological samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, they have a number of limitations related to sample collection and healthcare personnel safety. In this context, saliva is emerging as a promising alternative to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Saliva collection, being a non-invasive approach with possibility for self-collection, circumvents to a great extent the limitations associated with the use of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs.

Against this background we summarize here the current state of knowledge on the interaction of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 with mediators of the acute phase of inflammation (TNF, IL-1, IL-6), type 1 and type 17 immune responses (IL-12, IL-23, IL-17, IL-36), type 2 immune reactions (IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, IL-31, IgE), B-cell immunity, checkpoint regulators (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4), and orally druggable signaling pathways (JAK, PDE4, calcineurin). In addition, we discuss in this context non-specific immune modulation by glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, antimalarial drugs, azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil and fumaric acid esters, as well as neutrophil granulocyte-mediated innate immune mechanisms. From these recent findings we derive possible implications for the therapeutic modulation of said immunological mechanisms in connection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.

are exposed to an unprecedented stressful situation of unknown duration. This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels, but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home-schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.", "doi": "10.1111/jsr.13052", "pmid": "32246787", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T07:26:15.028Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T15:56:39.059Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "805eae795adb4cc5a630baf15dde1a2e", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/805eae795adb4cc5a630baf15dde1a2e.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/805eae795adb4cc5a630baf15dde1a2e"}}, "title": "Smell and taste alterations in COVID-19: a cross-sectional analysis of different cohorts.", "authors": [{"family": "Paderno", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schreiber", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Grammatica", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Raffetti", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Tomasoni", "given": "Michele", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gualtieri", "given": "Tommaso", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Taboni", "given": "Stefano", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Zorzi", "given": "Silvia", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Lombardi", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Deganello", "given": "Alberto", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Redaelli De Zinis", "given": "Luca Oscar", "initials": "LO"}, {"family": "Maroldi", "given": "Roberto", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Mattavelli", "given": "Davide", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-00", "journal": {"title": "Int Forum Allergy Rhinol", "issn": "2042-6984", "volume": "10", "issue": "8", "pages": "955-962", "issn-l": "2042-6976"}, "abstract": "Olfactory (OD) and gustatory (GD) dysfunction have been proven to be a typical symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Some cases rapidly develop deteriorating lung function, which causes deep hypoxaemia and requires urgent treatment. Many centres have started treating patients in the prone position, and oxygenation has improved considerably in some cases. Questions have been raised regarding the mechanisms behind this. The mini review provides some insights into the role of supine and prone body positions and summarises the latest understanding of the responsible mechanisms. The scope for discussion is outside the neonatal period and entirely based on experimental and clinical experiences related to adults. The human respiratory system is a complex interplay of many different variables. Therefore, this mini review has prioritised previous and ongoing research to find explanations based on three scientific areas: gravity, lung structure and fractal geometry and vascular regulation. It concludes that gravity is one of the variables responsible for ventilation/perfusion matching but in concert with lung structure and fractal geometry, ventilation and regulation of lung vascular tone. Since ventilation distribution does not change between supine and prone positions, the higher expression of nitric oxide in dorsal lung vessels than in ventral vessels is likely to be the most important mechanism behind enhanced oxygenation in the prone position.", "doi": "10.1111/apa.15382", "pmid": "32484966", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7301016"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T08:08:41.192Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:02:31.821Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "666b3cf7632f4444bc8e1b4aab6b02b4", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/666b3cf7632f4444bc8e1b4aab6b02b4.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/666b3cf7632f4444bc8e1b4aab6b02b4"}}, "title": "Global Survey on Pancreatic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "authors": [{"family": "Oba", "given": "Atsushi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Stoop", "given": "Thomas F", "initials": "TF"}, {"family": "L\u00f6hr", "given": "Matthias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hackert", "given": "Thilo", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Zyromski", "given": "Nicholas", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Nealon", "given": "William H", "initials": "WH"}, {"family": "Unno", "given": "Michiaki", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Schulick", "given": "Richard D", "initials": "RD"}, {"family": "Al-Musawi", "given": "Mohammed H", "initials": "MH"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Wenming", "initials": "W"}, {"family": "Zhao", "given": "Yupei", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Satoi", "given": "Sohei", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Wolfgang", "given": "Christopher L", "initials": "CL"}, {"family": "Abu Hilal", "given": "Mohammad", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Besselink", "given": "Marc G", "initials": "MG"}, {"family": "Del Chiaro", "given": "Marco", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pancreas Club, European Pancreatic Club, Chinese Pancreatic Surgery Association, European Consortium on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery, Study Group of Preoperative Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer, Study Group of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma with Peritoneal Metastasis and International Study Group on Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-00", "journal": {"title": "Ann Surg", "issn": "1528-1140", "volume": "272", "issue": "2", "pages": "e87-e93", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The aim of this study was to clarify the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic to optimize patients' and clinicians' safety and safeguard health care capacity.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacts health care systems worldwide.

of people dying from COVID-19 are reported, but data are lacking on the way they die. Background: To study symptoms and symptom relief during the last week of life, comparing nursing homes with hospitals. Objective: The Swedish Register of Palliative Care with national coverage was used. Breakthrough symptoms were registered as Yes/No. Symptom relief was recorded on a 3-grade scale as Design: complete-partial-no relief. All deaths in COVID-19 were contrasted to deaths in a reference population (deaths 2019). Deaths at nursing homes were compared with deaths in hospitals. All deaths in hospitals or nursing homes (Setting and Subjects: n = 490) were analyzed. Deaths in other settings (specialized palliative care wards [n = 11], in palliative home care [n = 2], or in their own homes [n = 8]) were excluded (n = 21). Only patients with expected deaths (n = 390) were entered in the final analysis. Breathlessness as a breakthrough symptom was more common in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 reference population (Results: p < 0.001) and relief of breathlessness, as well as anxiety, delirium, and death rattles was less successful in COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01 in different comparisons). Patients were older in nursing homes than in hospitals (86.6 years vs. 80.9 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (48% vs. 34%, p < 0.001). Breakthrough of breathlessness was much more frequently reported in hospital settings than in nursing homes, 73% versus 35% (p < 0.0001), and complete relief was more rarely possible in hospitals, 20% versus 42% (p < 0.01). The proportion of partial relief+complete relief was comparable, 92% versus 95% (ns). Also, anxiety and pain were more often completely relieved in nursing homes (p < 0.01 in both comparisons). The lower symptom prevalence in nursing homes may be explained by elderly frail residents dying already in the first phase of the COVID-19 disease, before acute respiratory distress syndrome develops.Conclusion:", "doi": "10.1089/jpm.2020.0249", "pmid": "32746685", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:02:24.617Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:45:02.026Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "df6d1ea6bc7443daabbea5f510146e0d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/df6d1ea6bc7443daabbea5f510146e0d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/df6d1ea6bc7443daabbea5f510146e0d"}}, "title": "Generalizability of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Clinical Prediction Models.", "authors": [{"family": "Hooli", "given": "Shubhada", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "King", "given": "Carina", "initials": "C"}], "type": "letter", "published": "2020-07-28", "journal": {"title": "Clin Infect Dis", "issn": "1537-6591", "volume": "71", "issue": "15", "pages": "897", "issn-l": "1058-4838"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/cid/ciaa417", "pmid": "32271865", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5818447"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7184363"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T17:15:23.515Z", "modified": "2020-11-22T17:15:23.526Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "97538cd2ee6649578f2a9df8210012f6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/97538cd2ee6649578f2a9df8210012f6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/97538cd2ee6649578f2a9df8210012f6"}}, "title": "Computational Studies of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro: Insights from MD Simulations.", "authors": [{"family": "Grottesi", "given": "Alessandro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Be\u0161ker", "given": "Neva", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Emerson", "given": "Andrew", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Manelfi", "given": "Candida", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Beccari", "given": "Andrea R", "initials": "AR"}, {"family": "Frigerio", "given": "Francesco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Lindahl", "given": "Erik", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Cerchia", "given": "Carmen", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Talarico", "given": "Carmine", "initials": "C"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-28", "journal": {"title": "Int J Mol Sci", "issn": "1422-0067", "volume": "21", "issue": "15", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Given the enormous social and health impact of the pandemic triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the scientific community made a huge effort to provide an immediate response to the challenges posed by Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One of the most important proteins of the virus is an enzyme, called 3CLpro or main protease, already identified as an important pharmacological target also in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) viruses. This protein triggers the production of a whole series of enzymes necessary for the virus to carry out its replicating and infectious activities. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of 3CLpro structure and function in order to effectively target this enzyme. All-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the different conformational behaviors of the monomeric and dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro apo structure, as revealed by microsecond time scale MD simulations. Our results also shed light on the conformational dynamics of the loop regions at the entry of the catalytic site. Studying, at atomic level, the characteristics of the active site and obtaining information on how the protein can interact with its substrates will allow the design of molecules able to block the enzymatic function crucial for the virus.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms21155346", "pmid": "32731361", "labels": {"Data type: Imaging data": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijms21155346"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7432786"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:07:31.972Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:07:31.984Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "e7c8cb8687554ac194841f84f0afae33", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e7c8cb8687554ac194841f84f0afae33.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/e7c8cb8687554ac194841f84f0afae33"}}, "title": "Review of guidelines and recommendations from 17 countries highlights the challenges that clinicians face caring for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19.", "authors": [{"family": "Yeo", "given": "Kee Thai", "initials": "KT"}, {"family": "Oei", "given": "Ju Lee", "initials": "JL"}, {"family": "De Luca", "given": "Daniele", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Schm\u00f6lzer", "given": "Georg M", "initials": "GM"}, {"family": "Guaran", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Palasanthiran", "given": "Pamela", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kumar", "given": "Kishore", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Buonocore", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Cheong", "given": "Jeanie", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Owen", "given": "Louise S", "initials": "LS"}, {"family": "Kusuda", "given": "Satoshi", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "James", "given": "Jennifer", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Lim", "given": "Gina", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Sharma", "given": "Ankur", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Uthaya", "given": "Sabita", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gale", "given": "Christopher", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Whittaker", "given": "Elizabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Battersby", "given": "Cheryl", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Modi", "given": "Neena", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Norman", "given": "Mikael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Naver", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Giannoni", "given": "Eric", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Diambomba", "given": "Yenge", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Shah", "given": "Prakeshkumar S", "initials": "PS"}, {"family": "Gagliardi", "given": "Luigi", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Harrison", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Pillay", "given": "Shakti", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Alburaey", "given": "Abdullah", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Yuan", "given": "Yuan", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Huayan", "initials": "H"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-27", "journal": {"title": "Acta Paediatr", "issn": "0803-5253", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "This review examined how applicable national and regional clinical practice guidelines and recommendations for managing neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 mothers were to the evolving pandemic.\n\nA systematic search and review identified 20 guidelines and recommendations that had been published by May 25, 2020.

Most did not provide recommendations for delivery methods or managing symptomatic infants. None provided recommendations for post-discharge assimilation of potentially infected infants into the community. The majority encouraged keeping mothers and infants together, subject to infection control measures, but one-third recommended separation.

However, a meta-analysis on the efficacy of steroids in treating these coronavirus infections is lacking. (2) Purpose: We assessed a methodological criticism on the quality of previous published meta-analyses and the risk of misleading conclusions with important therapeutic consequences. We also examined the evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in SARS, MERS and COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were used to identify studies published until 25 April 2020, that reported associations between steroid use and mortality in treating SARS/MERS/COVID-19. Two investigators screened and extracted data independently. Searches were restricted to studies on humans, and articles that did not report the exact number of patients in each group or data on mortality were excluded. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) under the fixed- and random-effect model. (4) Results: Eight articles (4051 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Among these selected studies, 3416 patients were diagnosed with SARS, 360 patients with MERS, and 275 with COVID-19; 60.3% patients were administered steroids. The meta-analyses including all studies showed no differences overall in terms of mortality (OR 1.152, 95% CI 0.631-2.101 in the random effects model, p = 0.645). However, this conclusion might be biased, because, in some studies, the patients in the steroid group had more severe symptoms than those in the control group. In contrast, when the meta-analysis was performed restricting only to studies that used appropriate adjustment (e.g., time, disease severity), there was a significant difference between the two groups (HR 0.378, 95% CI 0.221-0.646 in the random effects model, p < 0.0001). Although there was no difference in mortality when steroids were used in severe cases, there was a difference among the group with more underlying diseases (OR 3.133, 95% CI 1.670-5.877, p < 0.001). (5) Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis providing the most accurate evidence on the effect of steroids in coronavirus infections. If not contraindicated, and in the absence of side effects, the use of steroids should be considered in coronavirus infection including COVID-19.", "doi": "10.3390/jcm9082392", "pmid": "32726951", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "jcm9082392"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7465945"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-26T12:15:27.760Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:44:13.309Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "d94b8fd3ab114fbab0ca35902c0364b3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d94b8fd3ab114fbab0ca35902c0364b3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/d94b8fd3ab114fbab0ca35902c0364b3"}}, "title": "Compliance to Recommendations and Mental Health Consequences among Elderly in Sweden during the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross Sectional Online Survey.", "authors": [{"family": "Gustavsson", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Beckman", "given": "Linda", "initials": "L"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-26", "journal": {"title": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "issn": "1660-4601", "volume": "17", "issue": "15", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Background (1): In the wake of COVID-19, elderly people have been labelled a risk group.

However, unlike most other countries, much of Sweden's implementation focused on voluntary and stepwise action, rather than legislation and compulsory measures, leading to considerable attention in the international media.Six main narratives emerged in the international media reporting on Sweden during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) Life is normal in Sweden, (2) Sweden has a herd immunity strategy, (3) Sweden is not following expert advice, (4) Sweden is not following WHO recommendations (5) the Swedish approach is failing and (6) Swedes trust the government. While these narratives are partially grounded in reality, in some media outlets, the language and examples used to frame the story distorted the accuracy of the reporting.This debate examines the ways in which international media both constructs and represents a pandemic, and the implications for how researchers engage with news and social media. Cross-country comparison and the sharing of best practice are reliant on accurate information.

We established a translational approach combining home blood sampling by finger-pricking with multiplexed serology to assess the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a general population. The developed procedure determines the immune response in multiplexed assays against several spike (S, here denoted SPK), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NCP) proteins in eluates from dried capillary blood. The seroprevalence was then determined in two study sets by mailing 1000 blood sampling kits to random households in urban Stockholm during early and late April 2020, respectively. After receiving 55% (1097/2000) of the cards back within three weeks, 80% (878/1097) were suitable for the analyses of IgG and IgM titers. The data revealed diverse pattern of immune response, thus seroprevalence was dependent on the antigen, immunoglobulin class, stringency to include different antigens, as well as the required analytical performance. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction to the combined IgG and IgM data, 4.4% (19/435; 95% CI: 2.4%-6.3%) and 6.3% (28/443; 95% CI: 4.1%-8.6%) of the samples clustered with convalescent controls. Using overlapping scores from at least two SPK antigens, prevalence rates reached 10.1% (44/435; 95% CI: 7.3%-12.9%) in study set 1 and 10.8% (48/443; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.7%). Measuring the immune response against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a multiplexed workflow can provide valuable insights about the serological diversity and improve the certainty of the classification. Combining such assays with home-sampling of blood presents a viable strategy for individual-level diagnostics and towards an unbiased assessment of the seroprevalence in a population and may serve to improve our understanding about the diversity of COVID-19 etiology.", "doi": "10.1101/2020.07.01.20143966", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Data type: Health data": null, "Research Area: Biobanks for COVID-19 research": null, "Research Area: High-throughput and high-content serology": null, "Research Area: Host cell systems biology and targets": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Funder: VR: Special COVID-19 funding": null, "Data type: Serology data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-03T09:17:21.237Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T21:44:33.629Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9c6f1f68c72547ee948469c8d27d2ff3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9c6f1f68c72547ee948469c8d27d2ff3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9c6f1f68c72547ee948469c8d27d2ff3"}}, "title": "Rapid Detection of COVID-19 Coronavirus Using a Reverse Transcriptional Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) Diagnostic Platform", "authors": [{"family": "Yu", "given": "Lin", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Shanshan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hao", "given": "Xiaowen", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Dong", "given": "Xue", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Mao", "given": "Lingling", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Pelechano", "given": "Vicent", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Wei Hua", "initials": "WH"}, {"family": "Yin", "given": "Xiushan", "initials": "X"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"title": "Clinical Chem", "issn": "0009-9147", "volume": "66", "issue": "7", "pages": "975-977", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Letter to editor", "doi": "10.1093/clinchem/hvaa102", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Type: Journal article": null, "Type: Other": null, "Research Area: Diagnostics for virus": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T07:17:58.514Z", "modified": "2020-11-17T14:35:27.806Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "fb335d814dd541c58f67290f3969d67f", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/fb335d814dd541c58f67290f3969d67f.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/fb335d814dd541c58f67290f3969d67f"}}, "title": "COVID-19 Pandemic: Consensus guidelines for preferred practices in an aesthetic clinic.", "authors": [{"family": "Kapoor", "given": "Krishan M", "initials": "KM"}, {"family": "Chatrath", "given": "Vandana", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Boxley", "given": "Sarah G", "initials": "SG"}, {"family": "Nurlin", "given": "Iman", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Snozzi", "given": "Philippe", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Demosthenous", "given": "Nestor", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Belo", "given": "Victoria", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Chan", "given": "Wai M", "initials": "WM"}, {"family": "Kanaris", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Kapoor", "given": "Puneet", "initials": "P"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "Dermatol Ther", "issn": "1529-8019", "volume": "33", "issue": "4", "pages": "e13597", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Strict infection control measures in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic are expected to remain for an extended period.

"BackgroundA novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged at the end of 2019 and causes COVID-19, has resulted in worldwide human infections. While genetically distinct, SARS-CoV-1, the aetiological agent responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, utilises the same host cell receptor as SARS-CoV-2 for entry: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Parts of the SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoprotein (S protein), which interacts with ACE2, appear conserved in SARS-CoV-2.AimThe cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously generated against the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 was assessed.MethodsThe SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequence was aligned to those of SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and common-cold coronaviruses. Abilities of mAbs generated against SARS-CoV-1 S protein to bind SARS-CoV-2 or its S protein were tested with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as well as cells expressing either the full length protein or a fragment of its S2 subunit. Quantitative ELISA was also performed to compare binding of mAbs to recombinant S protein.ResultsAn immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-1 S protein is highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 but not in MERS and human common-cold coronaviruses. Four murine mAbs raised against this immunogenic fragment could recognise SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed in mammalian cell lines. In particular, mAb 1A9 was demonstrated to detect S protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and is suitable for use in a sandwich ELISA format.ConclusionThe cross-reactive mAbs may serve as useful tools for SARS-CoV-2 research and for the development of diagnostic assays for COVID-19.", "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.28.2000291", "pmid": "32700671", "labels": {"Data type: Imaging data": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7376845"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:22:09.955Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:22:09.968Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "72356b6b1430403297ae0fd5a1af6e57", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/72356b6b1430403297ae0fd5a1af6e57.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/72356b6b1430403297ae0fd5a1af6e57"}}, "title": "Ethical triage during the COVID-19 pandemic: a toolkit for neurosurgical resource allocation.", "authors": [{"family": "Hulsbergen", "given": "Alexander F C", "initials": "AFC"}, {"family": "Eijkholt", "given": "Marleen M", "initials": "MM"}, {"family": "Balak", "given": "Naci", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Brennum", "given": "Jannick", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Bolger", "given": "Ciar\u00e1n", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Bohrer", "given": "Anna-Margarete", "initials": "AM"}, {"family": "Feldman", "given": "Zeev", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Holsgrove", "given": "Daniel", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Kitchen", "given": "Neil", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Mathiesen", "given": "Tiit I", "initials": "TI"}, {"family": "Moojen", "given": "Wouter A", "initials": "WA"}, {"family": "Sampr\u00f3n", "given": "Nicol\u00e1s", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Sames", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sandvik", "given": "Ulrika", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Tisell", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Broekman", "given": "Marike L D", "initials": "MLD"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "Acta Neurochir (Wien)", "issn": "0942-0940", "volume": "162", "issue": "7", "pages": "1485-1490", "issn-l": "0001-6268"}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic confronts healthcare workers, including neurosurgeons, with difficult choices regarding which patients to treat.\n\nIn order to assist ethical triage, this article gives an overview of the main considerations and ethical principles relevant when allocating resources in times of scarcity.\n\nWe discuss a framework employing four principles: prioritizing the worst off, maximizing benefits, treating patients equally, and promoting instrumental value.

While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.", "doi": "10.1007/s40520-020-01601-4", "pmid": "32458356", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s40520-020-01601-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7248450"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T09:17:28.876Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:02:33.085Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "34041685e841481e8a7c442c69f3fa9d", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/34041685e841481e8a7c442c69f3fa9d.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/34041685e841481e8a7c442c69f3fa9d"}}, "title": "Addendum for Euro Surveill. 2020;25(3).", "authors": [{"family": "Eurosurveillance editorial team", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "30", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.30.2007302", "pmid": "32734858", "labels": {"Data type: Health data": null, "Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7393855"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T16:06:30.575Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T16:06:30.586Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "280d2226abe54b8989ec40218181f134", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/280d2226abe54b8989ec40218181f134.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/280d2226abe54b8989ec40218181f134"}}, "title": "Unconventional Answers to Unprecedented Challenges: The Swedish Experience During the COVID-19 Outbreak.", "authors": [{"family": "Valeriani", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Vukovic", "given": "Iris Sarajlic", "initials": "IS"}, {"family": "Mollica", "given": "Richard", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "J Prev Med Public Health", "issn": "2233-4521", "volume": "53", "issue": "4", "pages": "233-235", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Since its early stages, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed immense challenges in meeting the public health and healthcare and social care needs of migrants.

The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy.\n\nWe searched databases for all case reports and series from 12 February to 4 April 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed.\n\nEighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between 8 December 2019 and 1 April 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported.\n\nAlthough the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.", "doi": "10.1111/aogs.13867", "pmid": "32259279", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs":

As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae. We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health.", "doi": "10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-0606", "pmid": "32371551", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1055-9965.EPI-20-0606"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7357669"}, {"db": "mid", "key": "NIHMS1605601"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T09:10:08.022Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:10:08.046Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "021965c398864f9b8c7a42d09c6b08d0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/021965c398864f9b8c7a42d09c6b08d0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/021965c398864f9b8c7a42d09c6b08d0"}}, "title": "Oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic: challenges, dilemmas and the psychosocial impact on cancer patients.", "authors": [{"family": "Tsamakis", "given": "Konstantinos", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Gavriatopoulou", "given": "Maria", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Schizas", "given": "Dimitrios", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Stravodimou", "given": "Athina", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mougkou", "given": "Aikaterini", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tsiptsios", "given": "Dimitrios", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Sioulas", "given": "Vasileios", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Spartalis", "given": "Eleftherios", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Sioulas", "given": "Athanasios D", "initials": "AD"}, {"family": "Tsamakis", "given": "Charalampos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Charalampakis", "given": "Nikolaos", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Mueller", "given": "Christoph", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Arya", "given": "Donna", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Zarogoulidis", "given": "Paul", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Spandidos", "given": "Demetrios A", "initials": "DA"}, {"family": "Dimopoulos", "given": "Meletios A", "initials": "MA"}, {"family": "Papageorgiou", "given": "Charalabos", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Rizos", "given": "Emmanouil", "initials": "E"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "Oncol Lett", "issn": "1792-1074", "volume": "20", "issue": "1", "pages": "441-447", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "COVID-19 has caused unprecedented societal turmoil, triggering a rapid, still ongoing, transformation of healthcare provision on a global level.

As of now, COVID-19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2') within the spike protein. Given the high genomic similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. The cohesive approach amongst researchers across the globe has delivered high-end viral diagnostics. However, home-based point-of-care diagnostics are still under development, which may prove transformative in current COVID-19 pandemic containment. Similarly, vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 are currently in the pipeline for clinical trials.

Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread. In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region) generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region) 15-22 March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort. This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official data of total death counts up to 15 April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to 10 May 2020 for the number of cases.

The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1624 participants of which 1397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1111 participants of which 1023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scale's reliability and validity. Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores.

Determination of HCQ for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be performed in whole blood (WB), serum, and plasma. Direct comparisons of WB, serum, and plasma levels of HCQ in patients with SLE have not previously been reported. We describe a method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and compare the suitability of the three sample matrices.\r\n\r\nA method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision.\r\n\r\nA LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects.

There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer.

For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves.

economic hardship for individuals and hampers disease control efforts as people struggle to stay home when sick or advised to observe quarantine. Evidence on income security during periods of ill health is growing but has not previously been reviewed as a full body of work concerning low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We performed a scoping review to map the range, features, coverage, protective effects and equity of policies that aim to provide income security for adults whose ill health prevents them from participating in gainful work. A total of 134 studies were included, providing data from 95% of LMICs. However, data across the majority of these countries were severely limited. Collectively the included studies demonstrate that coverage of contributory income-security schemes is low, especially for informal and low-income workers. Meanwhile, non-contributory schemes targeting low-income groups are often not explicitly designed to provide income support in periods of ill health, they can be difficult to access and rarely provide sufficient income support to cover the needs of eligible recipients. While identifying an urgent need for more research on illness-related income security in LMICs, this review concludes that scaling up and diversifying the range of income security interventions is crucial for improving coverage and equity. To achieve these outcomes, illness-related income protection must receive greater recognition in health policy and health financing circles, expanding our understanding of financial hardship beyond direct medical costs.", "doi": "10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002425", "pmid": "32540963", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "bmjgh-2020-002425"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7299014"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T10:01:53.442Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T08:59:22.813Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8483b981df644399a2b16f6c0c276fa1", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8483b981df644399a2b16f6c0c276fa1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8483b981df644399a2b16f6c0c276fa1"}}, "title": "Systematic review of COVID\u201019 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults", "authors": [{"family": "Ludvigsson", "given": "Jonas F", "initials": "JF"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-06-00", "journal": {"title": "Acta Paediatr", "issn": "0803-5253", "volume": "109", "issue": "6", "pages": "1088-1095", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people.

Rapid and accurate tracking of aggregate population flows may therefore be epidemiologically informative. Here we use 11,478,484 counts of mobile phone data from individuals leaving or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan between 1 January and 24 January 2020 as they moved to 296 prefectures throughout mainland China. First, we document the efficacy of quarantine in ceasing movement. Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency and geographical distribution of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) until 19 February 2020, across mainland China. Third, we develop a spatio-temporal 'risk source' model that leverages population flow data (which operationalize the risk that emanates from epidemic epicentres) not only to forecast the distribution of confirmed cases, but also to identify regions that have a high risk of transmission at an early stage. Fourth, we use this risk source model to statistically derive the geographical spread of COVID-19 and the growth pattern based on the population outflow from Wuhan; the model yields a benchmark trend and an index for assessing the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 over time for different locations. This approach can be used by policy-makers in any nation with available data to make rapid and accurate risk assessments and to plan the allocation of limited resources ahead of ongoing outbreaks.", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-020-2284-y", "pmid": "32349120", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1038/s41586-020-2284-y"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T07:14:25.611Z", "modified": "2020-11-25T07:14:25.621Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7d9967664a4443e28cf52c8f6bf32d7a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7d9967664a4443e28cf52c8f6bf32d7a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7d9967664a4443e28cf52c8f6bf32d7a"}}, "title": "Flash survey on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections in paediatric patients on anticancer treatment.", "authors": [{"family": "Hrusak", "given": "Ondrej", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Kalina", "given": "Tomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Wolf", "given": "Joshua", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Balduzzi", "given": "Adriana", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Provenzi", "given": "Massimo", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rizzari", "given": "Carmelo", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Rives", "given": "Susana", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Del Pozo Carlavilla", "given": "Mar\u00eda", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Alonso", "given": "Maria E V", "initials": "MEV"}, {"family": "Dom\u00ednguez-Pinilla", "given": "Nerea", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Bourquin", "given": "Jean-Pierre", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Schmiegelow", "given": "Kjeld", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Attarbaschi", "given": "Andishe", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Grillner", "given": "Pernilla", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Mellgren", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "van der Werff Ten Bosch", "given": "Jutte", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Pieters", "given": "Rob", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Brozou", "given": "Triantafyllia", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Borkhardt", "given": "Arndt", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Escherich", "given": "Gabriele", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Lauten", "given": "Melchior", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Stanulla", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Smith", "given": "Owen", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Yeoh", "given": "Allen E J", "initials": "AEJ"}, {"family": "Elitzur", "given": "Sarah", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Vora", "given": "Ajay", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Li", "given": "Chi-Kong", "initials": "CK"}, {"family": "Ariffin", "given": "Hany", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Kolenova", "given": "Alexandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Dallapozza", "given": "Luciano", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Farah", "given": "Roula", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Lazic", "given": "Jelena", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Manabe", "given": "Atsushi", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Styczynski", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kovacs", "given": "Gabor", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Ottoffy", "given": "Gabor", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Felice", "given": "Maria S", "initials": "MS"}, {"family": "Buldini", "given": "Barbara", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Conter", "given": "Valentino", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Stary", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Schrappe", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-06-00", "journal": {"title": "Eur J Cancer", "issn": "1879-0852", "volume": "132", "issue": null, "pages": "11-16", "issn-l": "0959-8049"}, "abstract": "Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia.\n\nWe made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey.\n\nWe received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19.\n\nThus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021", "pmid": "32305831", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null, "Data type: Other data": null}, "xrefs":

We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.

COVID-19 is a global health challenge in the twenty-first century. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and its spread to regional countries and nowadays affecting more than 210 countries worldwide represents the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic has huge impacts on most aspects of human activities, as well as on the economy and health care systems. Lock-downs, quarantines and border closures in the wake of the pandemic have led to reductions in air pollution through decreased travel and production. These positive environmental effects are likely mostly temporary, but may serve as an example that changes in our way of life can have prompt positive effects for the environment and demonstrate the usefulness of travel-reducing measures such as teleconferencing. Thus, acknowledging that COVID-19 is first and foremost a global disaster, the pandemic may inspire to future behavioral changes with positive environmental effects.", "doi": "10.1080/20008686.2020.1768023", "pmid": "32922688", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1768023"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7448928"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-22T09:32:53.923Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:49:05.527Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "085268aa10e74516b1448ef2d74d1975", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/085268aa10e74516b1448ef2d74d1975.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/085268aa10e74516b1448ef2d74d1975"}}, "title": "Clinical and daily respiratory care and clinical trials within the COVID-19 era.", "authors": [{"family": "Bjermer", "given": "Leif", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Diamant", "given": "Zuzana", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Backer", "given": "Vibeke", "initials": "V"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-05-25", "journal": {"title": "Eur Clin Respir J", "issn": "2001-8525", "issn-l": null, "volume": "7", "issue": "1", "pages": "1766817"}, "abstract": "Editorial", "doi": "10.1080/20018525.2020.1766817", "pmid": "32922694", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1766817"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7448908"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:48:16.477Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:48:37.733Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7471dd74cf97437cb31db057a3d55c78", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7471dd74cf97437cb31db057a3d55c78.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7471dd74cf97437cb31db057a3d55c78"}}, "title": "The Covid-19 pandemic stress the need to build resilient production ecosystems.", "authors": [{"family": "Gordon", "given": "Line J", "initials": "LJ"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-23", "journal": {"title": "Agric Human Values", "issn": "0889-048X", "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": "1-2", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10460-020-10105-w", "pmid": "32836746", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10105"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7245175"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-07T11:32:08.285Z", "modified": "2020-12-07T11:32:08.308Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "6e381cbd252b437fa63080f76d62df4c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6e381cbd252b437fa63080f76d62df4c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/6e381cbd252b437fa63080f76d62df4c"}}, "title": "Relationship between odor intensity estimates and COVID-19 prevalence prediction in a Swedish population.", "authors": [{"family": "Iravani", "given": "Behzad", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Arshamian", "given": "Artin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ravia", "given": "Aharon", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Mishor", "given": "Eva", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Snitz", "given": "Kobi", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Shushan", "given": "Sagit", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Roth", "given": "Yehudah", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Perl", "given": "Ofer", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Honigstein", "given": "Danielle", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Weissgross", "given": "Reut", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Karagach", "given": "Shiri", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Ernst", "given": "Gernot", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Okamoto", "given": "Masako", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mainen", "given": "Zachary", "initials": "Z"}, {"family": "Monteleone", "given": "Erminio", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Dinnella", "given": "Caterina", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Spinelli", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Mari\u00f1o-S\u00e1nchez", "given": "Franklin", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ferdenzi", "given": "Camille", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Smeets", "given": "Monique", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Touhara", "given": "Kazushige", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bensafi", "given": "Moustafa", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hummel", "given": "Thomas", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Sobel", "given": "Noam", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Lundstr\u00f6m", "given": "Johan N", "initials": "JN"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-22", "journal": {"title": "Chem Senses", "issn": "1464-3553", "volume": null, "issue": null, "issn-l": "0379-864X"}, "abstract": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have implemented various strategies to reduce and slow the spread of the disease in the general population. For countries that have implemented restrictions on its population in a step-wise manner, monitoring of COVID-19 prevalence is of importance to guide decision on when to impose new, or when to abolish old, restrictions. We are here determining whether measures of odor intensity in a large sample can serve as one such measure. Online measures of how intense common household odors are perceived and symptoms of COVID-19 were collected from 2440 Swedes. Average odor intensity ratings were then compared to predicted COVID-19 population prevalence over time in the Swedish population and were found to closely track each other (r=-0.83). Moreover, we found that there was a large difference in rated intensity between individuals with and without COVID-19 symptoms and number of symptoms was related to odor intensity ratings. Finally, we found that individuals progressing from reporting no symptoms to subsequently reporting COVID-19 symptoms demonstrated a large drop in olfactory performance. These data suggest that measures of odor intensity, if obtained in a large and representative sample, can be used as an indicator of COVID-19 disease in the general population.

Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia. Coronaviruses code for an important multifunctional enzyme named papain-like protease (PLP), that has many roles in pathogenesis. First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication. Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the host's immune response that would otherwise hinder infection. Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins. Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response. PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro. In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms21103492", "pmid": "32429099", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "ijms21103492"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7278987"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-30T09:04:50.366Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:04:50.379Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9fc6eb922a5a4c6db0605957f1abc618", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9fc6eb922a5a4c6db0605957f1abc618.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9fc6eb922a5a4c6db0605957f1abc618"}}, "title": "Esophageal oncologic surgery in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) emergency.", "authors": [{"family": "Barbieri", "given": "Lavinia", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Talavera Urquijo", "given": "Eider", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Parise", "given": "Paolo", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Reynolds", "given": "John V", "initials": "JV"}, {"family": "Rosati", "given": "Riccardo", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-15", "journal": {"title": "Dis Esophagus", "issn": "1442-2050", "volume": "33", "issue": "5", "pages": null, "issn-l": "1120-8694"}, "abstract": "Guidelines", "doi": "10.1093/dote/doaa028", "pmid": "32322892", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "5823899"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7188144"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-23T11:45:36.075Z", "modified": "2020-11-23T11:45:53.080Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "82f77b7a55034feeac8377a79a71ead9", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/82f77b7a55034feeac8377a79a71ead9.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/82f77b7a55034feeac8377a79a71ead9"}}, "title": "Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Engineered Human Tissues Using Clinical-Grade Soluble Human ACE2.", "authors": [{"family": "Monteil", "given": "Vanessa", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Kwon", "given": "Hyesoo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Prado", "given": "Patricia", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Hagelkr\u00fcys", "given": "Astrid", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Wimmer", "given": "Reiner A", "initials": "RA"}, {"family": "Stahl", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Leopoldi", "given": "Alexandra", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Garreta", "given": "Elena", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Hurtado Del Pozo", "given": "Carmen", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Prosper", "given": "Felipe", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Romero", "given": "Juan Pablo", "initials": "JP"}, {"family": "Wirnsberger", "given": "Gerald", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Zhang", "given": "Haibo", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Slutsky", "given": "Arthur S", "initials": "AS"}, {"family": "Conder", "given": "Ryan", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Montserrat", "given": "Nuria", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Mirazimi", "given": "Ali", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Penninger", "given": "Josef M", "initials": "JM"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-14", "journal": {"title": "Cell", "issn": "1097-4172", "volume": "181", "issue": "4", "pages": "905-913.e7", "issn-l": "0092-8674"}, "abstract": "We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections.

However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to assess outbreak-related psychological distress and symptoms of acute stress reaction (ASR) in health professional students and to characterize individuals with potential need for interventions.\n\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 1442 health professional students at Sichuan University, China. At baseline (October 2019), participants were assessed for childhood adversity, stressful life events, internet addiction, and family functioning. Using multivariable logistic regression, we examined associations of the above exposures with subsequent psychological distress and ASR in response to the outbreak.\n\nThree hundred and eighty-four (26.63%) participants demonstrated clinically significant psychological distress, while 160 (11.10%) met the criterion for a probable ASR. Individuals who scored high on both childhood adversity and stressful life event experiences during the past year were at increased risks of both distress (ORs 2.00-2.66) and probable ASR (ORs 2.23-3.10), respectively. Moreover, internet addiction was associated with elevated risks of distress (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.60-2.64) and probable ASR (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.50-3.10). By contrast, good family functioning was associated with decreased risks of distress (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55) and probable ASR (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69). All associations were independent of baseline psychological distress.\n\nOur findings suggest that COVID-19 related psychological distress and high symptoms burden of ASR are common among health professional students.

Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).\n\nCOVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality.

The purpose of this document is to propose technical strategies to assist the pediatric surgeons to minimize the potential aerosolization of viral particles in COVID-19 patients undergoing urgent or emergent surgical treatment using laparoscopic approaches, based on the currently available literature. The situation and recommendations are subject to change with emerging information. Materials and Methods: The Scientific Committee and the Board of the European Society of Pediatric Endoscopic Surgeons gathered together in order to address the issue of minimally invasive surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search through PubMed, Embase, and World Wide Web of the terms \"COVID-19,\" \"Coronavirus,\" and \"SARS-CoV-2\" matched with \"pneumoperitoneum,\" \"laparoscopy,\" \"thoracoscopy,\" \"retroperitoneoscopy,\" and \"surgery\" was performed. Non-English language papers were excluded. A PRISMA report was performed. Criticalities were identified and a consensus was achieved over a number of key aspects. Results: We identified 121 documents. A total of 11 full-text documents were assessed to address all concerns related to the adoption of minimally invasive surgery. All aspect of pediatric minimally invasive surgery, including elective surgery, urgent surgery, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, retroperitoneoscopy, and pneumoperitoneum creation and maintainance were extensively addressed through systematic review. A consensus regarding urgent laparoscopic procedures, setting and operation techniques was obtained within the Committee and the Board. Conclusions: The ESPES proposes the following recommendations in case minimally invasive surgery is needed in a COVID-19 positive pediatric patients: (1) consider conservative treatment whenever safely possible, (2) dedicate a theater, columns and reusable laparoscopic instrumentation to COVID-19 pediatric patients, (3) prefer disposable instrumentation and cables, (4) use low CO2 insufflation pressures, (5) use low power electrocautery, (6) prefer closed-systems CO2 insufflation and desufflation systems, and (7) avoid leaks through ports.

There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels. Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males.\n\nBased on these observations we propose extracellular HMGB1 to be considered as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1186/s10020-020-00172-4", "pmid": "32380958", "labels": {"Type: Review": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1186/s10020-020-00172-4"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7203545"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T07:30:42.009Z", "modified": "2020-11-30T09:10:03.330Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "8f6f511b573945a1be8bb0f50b2f68ad", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8f6f511b573945a1be8bb0f50b2f68ad.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/8f6f511b573945a1be8bb0f50b2f68ad"}}, "title": "COVID-19: a challenge for oncology services.", "authors": [{"family": "Routy", "given": "Bertrand", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Derosa", "given": "Lisa", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Zitvogel", "given": "Laurence", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Kroemer", "given": "Guido", "initials": "G"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-05-05", "journal": {"title": "Oncoimmunology", "issn": "2162-4011", "volume": "9", "issue": "1", "pages": "1760686", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1080/2162402X.2020.1760686", "pmid": "32923119", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "1760686"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7458620"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-12-03T15:47:32.730Z", "modified": "2020-12-03T15:47:32.742Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "b405175e46c046df86d6925d657f3ed8", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b405175e46c046df86d6925d657f3ed8.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/b405175e46c046df86d6925d657f3ed8"}}, "title": "A united statement of the global chiropractic research community against the pseudoscientific claim that chiropractic care boosts immunity.", "authors": [{"family": "C\u00f4t\u00e9", "given": "Pierre", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Bussi\u00e8res", "given": "Andr\u00e9", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cassidy", "given": "J David", "initials": "JD"}, {"family": "Hartvigsen", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Kawchuk", "given": "Greg N", "initials": "GN"}, {"family": "Leboeuf-Yde", "given": "Charlotte", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Mior", "given": "Silvano", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Schneider", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "140 signatories# call for an end to pseudoscientific claims on the effect of chiropractic care on immune function", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-04", "journal": {"title": "Chiropr Man Therap", "issn": "2045-709X", "volume": "28", "issue": "1", "pages": "21", "issn-l": "2045-709X"}, "abstract": "In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) posted reports claiming that chiropractic care can impact the immune system.

cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.", "doi": "10.1007/s10654-020-00646-z", "pmid": "32424571", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Type: Review": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "10.1007/s10654-020-00646-z"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7233678"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-25T08:32:29.693Z", "modified": "2020-11-25T08:32:29.713Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "a25c8dcffb2040b787a0f1d3621f4dce", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a25c8dcffb2040b787a0f1d3621f4dce.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/a25c8dcffb2040b787a0f1d3621f4dce"}}, "title": "Practice recommendations for lung cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ESTRO-ASTRO consensus statement.", "authors": [{"family": "Guckenberger", "given": "Matthias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Belka", "given": "Claus", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Bezjak", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Bradley", "given": "Jeffrey", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Daly", "given": "Megan E", "initials": "ME"}, {"family": "DeRuysscher", "given": "Dirk", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Dziadziuszko", "given": "Rafal", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Faivre-Finn", "given": "Corinne", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Flentje", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Gore", "given": "Elizabeth", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Higgins", "given": "Kristin A", "initials": "KA"}, {"family": "Iyengar", "given": "Puneeth", "initials": "P"}, {"family": "Kavanagh", "given": "Brian D", "initials": "BD"}, {"family": "Kumar", "given": "Sameera", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Le Pechoux", "given": "Cecile", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Lievens", "given": "Yolande", "initials": "Y"}, {"family": "Lindberg", "given": "Karin", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "McDonald", "given": "Fiona", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ramella", "given": "Sara", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Rengan", "given": "Ramesh", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Ricardi", "given": "Umberto", "initials": "U"}, {"family": "Rimner", "given": "Andreas", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Rodrigues", "given": "George B", "initials": "GB"}, {"family": "Schild", "given": "Steven E", "initials": "SE"}, {"family": "Senan", "given": "Suresh", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Simone", "given": "Charles B", "initials": "CB 2nd"}, {"family": "Slotman", "given": "Ben J", "initials": "BJ"}, {"family": "Stuschke", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Videtic", "given": "Greg", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Widder", "given": "Joachim", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Yom", "given": "Sue S", "initials": "SS"}, {"family": "Palma", "given": "David", "initials": "D"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-05-00", "journal": {"title": "Radiother Oncol", "issn": "1879-0887", "volume": "146", "issue": null, "pages": "223-229", "issn-l": "0167-8140"}, "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC.\n\nIn a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.\n\nThis joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "doi":

The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (<0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats.

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a \"scaffolding\" role for Fc\u03b3R which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual Fc\u03b3R function and the complexity of the relationships between Fc\u03b3Rs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent \"next-gen\" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating Fc\u03b3Rs or the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of Fc\u03b3R interaction altogether.

First identified in Wuhan, China, a city of over 11 million, the disease has since spread to every continent except Antarctica. About 15% to 20% of all cases may be called severe, and it is believed many cases are asymptomatic. The average age of a person with COVID has been reported as 49 years. Worse outcomes are associated with geriatric populations and those with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular, respiratory disorders, and/or diabetes. The coronavirus, like other coronaviruses, is highly contagious and has a latency period of about 14 days. Most patients present with fever and a dry cough, but fever may be absent. Differential diagnosis can be challenging since influenza may present with similar symptoms. Chest radiography or computed tomography may be used to find evidence of secondary pneumonia. Nosocomial infection is of concern, and it has been reported that 3.8% of all cases with COVID-19 in that country involve healthcare workers in China. Most patients have mild disease, and supportive care suffices. A variety of repurposed and investigational drugs are being evaluated.

Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties.\r\n\r\nAfter panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency ( \u03b1 = .82) and test-retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459).\r\n\r\nThe Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.", "doi": "10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8", "pmid":

more than 100,000 confirmed infections and 4000 fatalities (as of 10 March 2020). The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.", "doi": "10.4414/smw.2020.20224", "pmid": "32176808", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "Swiss Med Wkly. 2020;150:w20224"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-17T17:38:57.263Z", "modified": "2020-11-23T11:25:44.974Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "f4cd5fc5b81b412089e6ad0921ece7a0", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f4cd5fc5b81b412089e6ad0921ece7a0.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/f4cd5fc5b81b412089e6ad0921ece7a0"}}, "title": "Coronavirus infections: Epidemiological, clinical and immunological features and hypotheses.", "authors": [{"family": "Raoult", "given": "Didier", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Zumla", "given": "Alimuddin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Locatelli", "given": "Franco", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Ippolito", "given": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Kroemer", "given": "Guido", "initials": "G"}], "type": "editorial", "published": "2020-03-02", "journal": {"title": "Cell Stress", "issn": "2523-0204", "volume": "4", "issue": "4", "pages": "66-75", "issn-l": "2523-0204"}, "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses. Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.", "doi": "10.15698/cst2020.04.216", "pmid": "32292881", "labels": {"Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "pii", "key": "CST0270E115"}, {"db": "pmc", "key": "PMC7064018"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-23T11:27:23.267Z", "modified": "2020-11-23T11:27:43.342Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "eea6eb2eee9947eead710b14e91c253a", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eea6eb2eee9947eead710b14e91c253a.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/eea6eb2eee9947eead710b14e91c253a"}}, "title": "Potential scenarios for the progression of a COVID-19 epidemic in the European Union and the European Economic Area, March 2020.", "authors": [{"family": "Johnson", "given": "Helen C", "initials": "HC"}, {"family": "Gossner", "given": "C\u00e9line M", "initials": "CM"}, {"family": "Colzani", "given": "Edoardo", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Kinsman", "given": "John", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Alexakis", "given": "Leonidas", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Beaut\u00e9", "given": "Julien", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "W\u00fcrz", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Tsolova", "given": "Svetla", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Bundle", "given": "Nick", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Ekdahl", "given": "Karl", "initials": "K"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-03-00", "journal": {"title": "Euro Surveill", "issn": "1560-7917", "volume": "25", "issue": "9", "issn-l": null}, "abstract": "Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely.

Although the diagnostics of acute patients by RT-PCR is both efficient and specific, we are also crucially in need of serological tools for investigating antibody responses and assessing individual and potential herd immunity. We evaluated a commercially available test developed for rapid (within 15 minutes) detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG by 29 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 124 negative controls. The results revealed a sensitivity of 69% and 93.1% for IgM and IgG, respectively, based solely on PCR-positivity due to the absence of a serological gold standard. The assay specificities were shown to be 100% for IgM and 99.2% for IgG. This indicates that the test is suitable for assessing previous virus exposure, although negative results may be unreliable during the first weeks after infection.

Hereby, based on literature review from the current pandemic and previous outbreaks with corona viruses we analyze the impact of the virus infection on cell stress responses and redox balance. High levels of mortality are noticed in elderly individuals infected with SARS-CoV2 and during the previous SARS-CoV1 outbreak. Elderly individuals maintain a chronic low level of inflammation which is associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production, a condition that increases the severity of viral infections in this population. Coronavirus infections can lead to alterations of redox balance in infected cells through modulation of NAD + biosynthesis, PARP function along with altering proteasome and mitochondrial function in the cell thereby leading to enhanced cell stress responses which further exacerbate inflammation. ROS production can increase IL-6 production and lipid peroxidation resulting in cell damage. Therefore, early treatment with anti-oxidants such as NAC during COVID-19 can be a way to bypass the excessive inflammation and cell damage that lead to severe infection, thus early NAC as intervention should be evaluated in a clinical trial setti", "doi": "10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.06.003", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Type: Review": null, "Research Area: Drug discovery and repurposing of drugs": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T07:09:44.267Z", "modified": "2020-11-25T08:20:44.275Z"}]}
