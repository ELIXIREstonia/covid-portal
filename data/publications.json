This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset.\n\nSARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels were quantified using two clinically validated and widely used commercial serological assays (Architect, Abbott Laboratories and iFlash 1800, YHLO), detecting antibodies against the spike and nucleocapsid proteins.\n\nForty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P = 0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset.\n\nPatients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity.

All PCR+ individuals in the study became IgG-positive against pre-fusion trimers of the virus spike (S) glycoprotein, but titers varied greatly. Elevated IgA, IL-6 and neutralizing responses were present in intensive care patients. Additionally, blood donors and pregnant women (n=2,900) sampled throughout the first wave of the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden, further demonstrated that anti-S IgG titers differed several orders of magnitude between individuals, with an increase of low titer values present in the population at later time points (4,5).

The SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 10 (nsp10) displays high sequence similarity with its SARS homologue, which binds to and stimulates the 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease and the 2'-O-methlytransferase activities of nsps 14 and 16, respectively.

The crystal structure and solution behaviour of nsp10 will not only form the basis for understanding the role of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10 as a central player of the viral RNA capping apparatus, but will also serve as a basis for the development of inhibitors of nsp10, interfering with crucial functions of the replication-transcription complex and virus replication.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms21197375", "pmid": "33036230", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Protein data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "PDB", "key": "6ZPE", "description": "Nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) from SARS CoV-2, 1.58\u00c5 resolution"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "6ZCT", "description": "Nonstructural protein 10 (nsp10) from SARS CoV-2, 2.55\u00c5 resolution"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/19/7375/s1", "description": "Supplementary materials"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:23:12.306Z", "modified": "2020-10-30T12:32:34.990Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7cea9ce7584b467692597202c1fba7d1", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7cea9ce7584b467692597202c1fba7d1.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7cea9ce7584b467692597202c1fba7d1"}}, "title": "CSF biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms: A case series.", "authors": [{"family": "Ed\u00e9n", "given": "Arvid", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Kanberg", "given": "Nelly", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Gostner", "given": "Johanna", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Fuchs", "given": "Dietmar", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Hagberg", "given": "Lars", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "Lars-Magnus", "initials": "LM"}, {"family": "Lindh", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Price", "given": "Richard W", "initials": "RW"}, {"family": "Zetterberg", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Gissl\u00e9n", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-10-01", "journal": {"title": "Neurology", "issn": "1526-632X", "volume": null, "issue": null}, "abstract": "To explore whether hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and neurologic symptoms have evidence of CNS infection, inflammation and injury using CSF biomarker measurements.\n\nWe assessed CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA along with CSF biomarkers of intrathecal inflammation (CSF white blood cell count, neopterin, \u03b2 2-microglobulin (\u03b22M) and immunoglobulin G-index), blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity (albumin ratio), and axonal injury (CSF neurofilament light chain protein [NfL]) in 6 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms who had undergone a diagnostic lumbar puncture.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method: All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500\u22124500 IU tinzaparin or 2500\u22125000 IU dalteparin), medium (>4500 IU but <175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or >5000 IU but <200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose (\u2265 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or \u2265200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body-mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. Results: A total of 152 patients were included; 67 received low, 48 medium, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mortality was lower in high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%) groups, p\u22610.02.

Using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we confirm effectiveness of heat inactivation by plaque assay and evaluate various generic buffers as transport medium for direct RT-PCR.

We utilise mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model.\n\nThe changes in mobility have a considerable overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The shift in mobility in all categories shows high correlations with the death rates 1 month later. Reduction of movement within the grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for most of the decrease in R0.\n\nOur model predicts 3-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium.

Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the 'up' and 'down' conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.", "doi": null, "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:40:52.446Z", "modified": "2020-10-30T12:31:58.472Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81"}}, "title": "Natural killer cell immunotypes related to COVID-19 disease severity.", "authors": [{"family": "Maucourant", "given": "Christopher", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Filipovic", "given": "Iva", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ponzetta", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Cornillet", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hertwig", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Strunz", "given": "Benedikt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lentini", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Reinius", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Brownlie", "given": "Demi", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Cuapio", "given": "Angelica", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ask", "given": "Eivind Heggernes", "initials": "EH"}, {"family": "Hull", "given": "Ryan M", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "Haroun-Izquierdo", "given": "Alvaro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schaffer", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Klingstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Folkesson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Buggert", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Johan K", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Lars I", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "Rooyackers", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Ljunggren", "given": "Hans-Gustaf", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Malmberg", "given": "Karl-Johan", "initials": "KJ"}, {"family": "Micha\u00eblsson", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Marquardt", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hammer", "given": "Quirin", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkstr\u00f6m", "given": "Niklas K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-21", "journal": {"title": "Sci Immunol", "issn": "2470-9468", "volume": "5", "issue": "50"}, "abstract": "Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important to decipher mechanisms of host responses and interpret disease pathogenesis.

These results suggest that antibody testing of employees in elderly care homes is valuable for surveillance of disease development and a crucial screening tool in the effort to decrease the death toll in this pandemic.", "doi": "10.1080/20008686.2020.1789036", "pmid": "32939231", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Health data": null, "Data type: Other data types > Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "URL", "key": "https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2020.1789036", "description": "Serological responses of 1,005 employees to SARS-CoV-2 at 22 different elderly care homes in Stockholm"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:59:27.014Z", "modified": "2020-10-30T12:32:16.967Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "137eb41ee24d46898ba5785cebd6f1df", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/137eb41ee24d46898ba5785cebd6f1df.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/137eb41ee24d46898ba5785cebd6f1df"}}, "title": "Hyperreninemia and low total body water may contribute to acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients in intensive care.", "authors": [{"family": "Hultstr\u00f6m", "given": "Michael", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "von Seth", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Frithiof", "given": "Robert", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-00", "journal": {"title": "J Hypertens", "issn": "1473-5598", "volume": "38", "issue": "8", "pages": "1613-1614"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1097/HJH.0000000000002531", "pmid": "32472780", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Provided in the paper (N=9 patients)", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:42:00.648Z", "modified": "2020-10-30T12:31:40.122Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0bae1af9dc684896ba70dd3a1f4635f3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0bae1af9dc684896ba70dd3a1f4635f3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0bae1af9dc684896ba70dd3a1f4635f3"}}, "title": "Proteomic blood profiling in mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients", "authors": [{"family": "Patel", "given": "Hamel", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Ashton", "given": "Nicholas J", "initials": "NJ"}, {"family": "Dobson", "given": "Richard J", "initials": "RJ"}, {"family": "Anderson", "given": "Lars-magnus", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Yilmaz", "given": "Aylin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Blennow", "given": "Kaj", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Gisslen", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Zetterberg", "given": "Henrik", "initials": "H"}], "type": null, "published": "2020-06-23", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic manifests itself as a mild respiratory tract infection in the majority of individuals leading to COVID-19 disease. However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The purpose of this study is to explore the proteomic differences between mild, severe and critical COVID-19 positive patients. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n=26), severe (n=9) or critical (n=24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/.

Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes in human fetal and adult brain samples. We show significant differences in RNA expression for protein-coding and lncRNA genes between cytosol and nucleus. Transcripts displaying differential subcellular localization belong to particular functional categories and display tissue-specific localization patterns. We also show that transcripts encoding the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are significantly enriched in the cytosol compared to the rest of protein-coding genes. Further investigation of the use of the cytosolic or the nuclear transcriptome for differential gene expression analysis indicates important differences in results depending on the cellular compartment. These differences were manifested at the level of transcript types and the number of differentially expressed genes.
