To describe the phenotypic landscape of circulating ILCs in COVID-19 patients and to identify ILC phenotypes correlated to serum biomarkers, clinical markers, and laboratory parameters relevant in COVID-19.\r\n\r\nMethods Blood samples collected from moderately (n=11) and severely ill (n=12) COVID-19 patients as well as healthy control donors (n=16), were analyzed with 18-parameter flow cytometry. Using supervised and unsupervised approaches, we examined the ILC activation status and homing profile. Clinical and laboratory parameters were obtained from all COVID-19 patients and serum biomarkers were analyzed with multiplex immunoassays.\r\n\r\nResults ILCs were largely depleted from the circulation of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Remaining circulating ILCs from patients revealed increased frequencies of ILC2 in moderate COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease of ILC precursors (ILCp), as compared with controls. ILC2 and ILCp showed an activated phenotype with increased CD69 expression, whereas expression levels of the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR4 were significantly altered in ILC2 and ILCp, and ILC1, respectively.

Design: Systematic analysis. Data sources: Worldometer, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, United Nations Main outcome measures: The explanators of nDpm and CFR were mathematically hypothesised and tested on publicly-available data from 88 countries with linear regression models on May 1st 2020. The derived explanators - age-adjusted infection fatality rate (IFRadj) and case detection rate (CDR) - were estimated for each country based on a SARS-CoV-2 model of China. The accuracy and agreement of the models with observed data was assessed with R2 and Bland-Altman plots, respectively. Sensitivity analyses involved removal of outliers and testing the models at five retrospective and two prospective time points. Results: Globally, IFRadj estimates varied between countries, ranging from below 0.2% in the youngest nations, to above 1.3% in Portugal, Greece, Italy, and Japan. The median estimated global CDR of SARS-CoV-2 infections on April 16th 2020 was 12.9%, suggesting that most of the countries have a much higher number of cases than reported. At least 93% and up to 99% of the variance in nDpm was explained by reported prevalence expressed as cases per million citizens (nCpm), IFRadj, and CDR. IFRadj and CDR accounted for up to 97% of the variance in CFR, but this model was less reliable than the nDpm model, being sensitive to outliers (R2 as low as 67.5%). Conclusions: The current differences in SARS-CoV-2 mortality between countries are driven mainly by reported prevalence of infections, age distribution, and CDR. The nDpm might be a more stable estimate than CFR in comparing mortality burden between countries.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.20114934", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Type: Preprint": null, "Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T15:42:54.004Z", "modified": "2020-11-09T15:20:43.100Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "0be77bad07c449b1adfe016d20bbdcd6", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0be77bad07c449b1adfe016d20bbdcd6.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/0be77bad07c449b1adfe016d20bbdcd6"}}, "title": "Detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals by a sensitive S-based ELISA.", "authors": [{"family": "Rosendal", "given": "Ebba", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Wigren", "given": "Julia", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Groening", "given": "Remigius", "initials": "R"}, {"family": "Yongdae", "given": "Kwon", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Nilsson", "given": "Emma", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Sharma", "given": "Atin", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Espaillat", "given": "Akbar", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Hanke", "given": "Leo", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Thunberg", "given": "Therese", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "McInerney", "given": "Gerald", "initials": "G"}, {"family": "Puhar", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Cava", "given": "Felipe", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Karlsson Hedestam", "given": "Gunilla B", "initials": "GB"}, {"family": "Monsen", "given": "Tor", "initials": "T"}, {"family": "Elgh", "given": "Fredrik", "initials": "F"}, {"family": "Blomkvist", "given": "Bert", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Marklund", "given": "Ingrid", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ahlm", "given": "Clas", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Evander", "given": "Magnus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Normark", "given": "Johan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Johansson", "given": "Anderrs", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Overby", "given": "Anna K", "initials": "AK"}, {"family": "Forsell", "given": "Mattias", "initials": "M"}], "type": null, "published": "2020-11-04", "journal": {"title": "medRxiv", "issn": null, "volume": null, "issue": null, "pages": null}, "abstract": "o assess the current coronavirus pandemic, there is a pressing need to determine the exposure and seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 on a local and global level.

Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset.\r\n\r\nPatients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients and the risk of death, thromboembolism, and bleeding. Method: All critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two intensive care units in March and April 2020 were eligible. Patients were categorized into three groups according to initial daily dose of thromboprophylaxis: low (2500\u22124500 IU tinzaparin or 2500\u22125000 IU dalteparin), medium (>4500 IU but <175 IU/kilogram, kg, of body weight tinzaparin or >5000 IU but <200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin), and high dose (\u2265 175 IU/kg of body weight tinzaparin or \u2265200 IU/kg of body weight dalteparin). Thromboprophylaxis dosage was based on local standardized recommendations, not on degree of critical illness or risk of thrombosis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals of death within 28 days from ICU admission. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, age, body-mass index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, invasive respiratory support, and initial dosing strategy of thromboprophylaxis. Results: A total of 152 patients were included; 67 received low, 48 medium, and 37 high dose thromboprophylaxis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Mortality was lower in high (13.5%) vs medium (25.0%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (38.8%) groups, p\u22610.02. The hazard ratio of death was 0.33 (95% confidence intervals 0.13 \u2212 0.87) among those who received high dose, respectively 0.88 (95% confidence intervals 0.43 \u2212 1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared with those who received low dose thromboprophylaxis. There were fewer thromboembolic events in the high (2.7%) vs medium (18.8%) and low dose thromboprophylaxis (17.9%) groups, p\u22610.04, but no difference in the proportion of bleeding events, p\u22610.16.

Methodological simplification could increase diagnostic availability and efficiency, benefitting patient care and infection control. Here, we describe methods circumventing RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-PCR directly on heat-inactivated or lysed samples. Our data, including benchmarking using 597 clinical patient samples and a standardised diagnostic system, demonstrate that direct RT-PCR is viable option to extraction-based tests. Using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we confirm effectiveness of heat inactivation by plaque assay and evaluate various generic buffers as transport medium for direct RT-PCR. Significant savings in time and cost are achieved through RNA-extraction-free protocols that are directly compatible with established PCR-based testing pipelines.

We utilise mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R0 is estimated through the model.\n\nThe changes in mobility have a considerable overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change.

Reduction of movement within the grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for most of the decrease in R0.\n\nOur model predicts 3-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium.

Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the 'up' and 'down' conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5", "pmid": "32887876", "labels": {"Type: Journal article": null, "Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Funder: VR": null, "Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "GENBANK", "key": "MT784731", "description": "Sequence of Ty1"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://github.com/derpaule/Ty1_octet_itc", "description": "ITC data"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://github.com/MurrellGroup/Ty1", "description": "Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the NGS data processing"}, {"db": "URL", "key": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/emdb/EMD-11526", "description": "EMDB EMD-11526: Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to neutralizing nanobodies"}, {"db": "PDB", "key": "6ZXN", "description": "Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound to neutralizing nanobodies (Ty1)"}, {"db": "BioProject", "key": "PRJNA638614", "description": "Next generation sequencing data"}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-28T09:09:58.686Z", "modified": "2020-11-04T16:13:43.442Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7b945315d0934beba3a131f7efdb347c", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7b945315d0934beba3a131f7efdb347c.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7b945315d0934beba3a131f7efdb347c"}}, "title": "Inadequate prophylactic effect of low-molecular weight heparin in critically ill COVID-19 patients.", "authors": [{"family": "Stattin", "given": "K", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Lipcsey", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Andersson", "given": "H", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Pont\u00e9n", "given": "E", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "B\u00fclow Anderberg", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Gradin", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Larsson", "given": "A", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Lubenow", "given": "N", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "von Seth", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Rubertsson", "given": "S", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hultstr\u00f6m", "given": "M", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Frithiof", "given": "R", "initials": "R"}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-09-03", "journal": {"title": "J Crit Care", "issn": "1557-8615", "volume": "60", "issue": null, "pages": "249-252"}, "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate potential markers of coagulopathy and the effects of thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on thromboelastography (TEG) and anti-factor Xa in critically ill COVID-19 patients.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a prospective study in 31 consecutive adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.19.20178178", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Type: Preprint": null, "Data type: Biochemistry": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-10-30T11:40:52.446Z", "modified": "2020-11-09T15:50:13.336Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/7fd7c180f0204f0993b027f3d0d7bc81"}}, "title": "Natural killer cell immunotypes related to COVID-19 disease severity.", "authors": [{"family": "Maucourant", "given": "Christopher", "initials": "C"}, {"family": "Filipovic", "given": "Iva", "initials": "I"}, {"family": "Ponzetta", "given": "Andrea", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Aleman", "given": "Soo", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Cornillet", "given": "Martin", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Hertwig", "given": "Laura", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Strunz", "given": "Benedikt", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Lentini", "given": "Antonio", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Reinius", "given": "Bj\u00f6rn", "initials": "B"}, {"family": "Brownlie", "given": "Demi", "initials": "D"}, {"family": "Cuapio", "given": "Angelica", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Ask", "given": "Eivind Heggernes", "initials": "EH"}, {"family": "Hull", "given": "Ryan M", "initials": "RM"}, {"family": "Haroun-Izquierdo", "given": "Alvaro", "initials": "A"}, {"family": "Schaffer", "given": "Marie", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Klingstr\u00f6m", "given": "Jonas", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Folkesson", "given": "Elin", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Buggert", "given": "Marcus", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Sandberg", "given": "Johan K", "initials": "JK"}, {"family": "Eriksson", "given": "Lars I", "initials": "LI"}, {"family": "Rooyackers", "given": "Olav", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Ljunggren", "given": "Hans-Gustaf", "initials": "HG"}, {"family": "Malmberg", "given": "Karl-Johan", "initials": "KJ"}, {"family": "Micha\u00eblsson", "given": "Jakob", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Marquardt", "given": "Nicole", "initials": "N"}, {"family": "Hammer", "given": "Quirin", "initials": "Q"}, {"family": "Str\u00e5lin", "given": "Kristoffer", "initials": "K"}, {"family": "Bj\u00f6rkstr\u00f6m", "given": "Niklas K", "initials": "NK"}, {"family": "Karolinska COVID-19 Study Group", "given": "", "initials": ""}], "type": "journal article", "published": "2020-08-21", "journal": {"title": "Sci Immunol", "issn": "2470-9468", "volume": "5", "issue": "50"}, "abstract": "Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important to decipher mechanisms of host responses and interpret disease pathogenesis.

Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks. However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.\r\n\r\nChildren are unlikely to be the main drivers of the pandemic.

We established a translational approach combining home blood sampling by finger-pricking with multiplexed serology to assess the exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a general population. The developed procedure determines the immune response in multiplexed assays against several spike (S, here denoted SPK), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NCP) proteins in eluates from dried capillary blood. The seroprevalence was then determined in two study sets by mailing 1000 blood sampling kits to random households in urban Stockholm during early and late April 2020, respectively. After receiving 55% (1097/2000) of the cards back within three weeks, 80% (878/1097) were suitable for the analyses of IgG and IgM titers. The data revealed diverse pattern of immune response, thus seroprevalence was dependent on the antigen, immunoglobulin class, stringency to include different antigens, as well as the required analytical performance. Applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction to the combined IgG and IgM data, 4.4% (19/435; 95% CI: 2.4%-6.3%) and 6.3% (28/443; 95% CI: 4.1%-8.6%) of the samples clustered with convalescent controls. Using overlapping scores from at least two SPK antigens, prevalence rates reached 10.1% (44/435; 95% CI: 7.3%-12.9%) in study set 1 and 10.8% (48/443; 95% CI: 7.9%-13.7%). Measuring the immune response against several SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a multiplexed workflow can provide valuable insights about the serological diversity and improve the certainty of the classification. Combining such assays with home-sampling of blood presents a viable strategy for individual-level diagnostics and towards an unbiased assessment of the seroprevalence in a population and may serve to improve our understanding about the diversity of COVID-19 etiology.", "doi": "10.1101/2020.07.01.20143966", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Data type: Other data types > Serology data": null, "Type: Preprint": null, "Data type: Health data": null}, "xrefs": [{"db": "NA", "key": "Available on request", "description": null}], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-03T09:17:21.237Z", "modified": "2020-11-03T10:17:03.909Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "9c6f1f68c72547ee948469c8d27d2ff3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9c6f1f68c72547ee948469c8d27d2ff3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/9c6f1f68c72547ee948469c8d27d2ff3"}}, "title": "Rapid Detection of COVID-19 Coronavirus Using a Reverse Transcriptional Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) Diagnostic Platform", "authors": [{"family": "Yu", "given": "Lin", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Wu", "given": "Shanshan", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Hao", "given": "Xiaowen", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Dong", "given": "Xue", "initials": "X"}, {"family": "Mao", "given": "Lingling", "initials": "L"}, {"family": "Pelechano", "given": "Vicent", "initials": "V"}, {"family": "Chen", "given": "Wei Hua", "initials": "WH"}, {"family": "Yin", "given": "Xiushan", "initials": "X"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-07-01", "journal": {"title": "", "issn": "0009-9147", "volume": "66", "issue": "7", "pages": "975-977"}, "abstract": null, "doi": "10.1093/clinchem/hvaa102", "pmid": null, "labels": {"Funder: KAW/SciLifeLab": null, "Type: Journal article": null, "Type: Other": null}, "xrefs": [], "notes": [], "qc": null, "created": "2020-11-04T07:17:58.514Z", "modified": "2020-11-04T07:17:58.527Z"}, {"entity": "publication", "iuid": "237450facd3243e6a1f106b316d527f3", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/237450facd3243e6a1f106b316d527f3.json"}, "display": {"href": "https://publications-covid19.scilifelab.se/publication/237450facd3243e6a1f106b316d527f3"}}, "title": "Current Status of COVID-19 Therapies and Drug Repositioning Applications", "authors": [{"family": "Altay", "given": "Ozlem", "initials": "O"}, {"family": "Mohammadi", "given": "Elyas", "initials": "E"}, {"family": "Lam", "given": "Simon", "initials": "S"}, {"family": "Turkez", "given": "Hasan", "initials": "H"}, {"family": "Boren", "given": "Jan", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Nielsen", "given": "Jens", "initials": "J"}, {"family": "Uhlen", "given": "Mathias", "initials": "M"}, {"family": "Mardinoglu", "given": "Adil", "initials": "A"}], "type": "journal-article", "published": "2020-07-00", "journal": {"title": "iScience", "issn": "2589-0042", "volume": "23", "issue": "7", "pages": "101303"}, "abstract": "The rapid and global spread of a new human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has produced an immediate urgency to discover promising targets for the treatment of COVID-19.

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. The purpose of this study is to explore the proteomic differences between mild, severe and critical COVID-19 positive patients. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n=26), severe (n=9) or critical (n=24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/.
